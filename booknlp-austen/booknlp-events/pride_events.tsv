Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	Elizabeth felt Jane ’s pleasure . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	lose	“ But I can assure you , ” she added , “ that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	“ He is just what a young - man ought to be , ” said she , “ sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! ” “ He is also handsome , ” replied Elizabeth , “ which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	listened	Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced : their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment , too , unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	forgive	“ That is very true , ” replied Elizabeth , “ and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value , as arising , in all probability , from the influence of their brother ’s admiration . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	do	“ Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ’s disposition as you do . ” “ But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ” “ Your plan is a good one , ” replied Elizabeth , “ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	represent	“ Not as you represent it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	imagine	“ Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ” “ Well , ” said Charlotte , “ I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	becoming	You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ” Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley ’s attention to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty : he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ What does Mr. Darcy mean , ” said she to Charlotte , “ by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? ” “ That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	let	“ But if he does it any more , I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	know	“ I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	dancing	He paused in hopes of an answer : but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her,-- “ My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	allow	Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	excel	“ You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wishing	I knew you would be wishing me joy . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	have	You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . ” He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed along .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ That would be a good scheme , ” said Elizabeth , “ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	go	“ I had much rather go in the coach . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	get	“ They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ But if you have got them to - day , ” said Elizabeth , “ my mother ’s purpose will be answered . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	extort	She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	hear	They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	read	“ Well , my dear , ” said Mr. Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , “ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	set	Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	continued	In Meryton they parted : the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ’ wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles , with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	walked	That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	coming	The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion ’s justifying her coming so far alone .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	She had very little notice from any but him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	sat	Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr. Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who , when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	feel	Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wonder	I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	call	If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ” “ It _ is _ wonderful , ” replied Wickham ; “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	related	Elizabeth related to Jane , the next day , what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thought	Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy ’s look and behaviour . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	help	Elizabeth ’s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley ’s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	observed	The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	choose	Elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	found	Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia .

Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	tried	Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	ceased	Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus,-- “ My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	allow	You must , therefore , allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	laughing	But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . ” The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued,-- “ My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	feeling	Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	persisted	In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	dwelt	Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	began	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	feared	The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters , and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	left	Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenour of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	recommended	Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	tell	Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	But really , ma’am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	give	“ Upon my word , ” said her Ladyship , “ you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	suspected	Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wondered	Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect : but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	recollected	Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	examined	She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins ’s joints of meat were too large for her family .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	perceived	Elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	spent	This , however , was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough : there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	went	Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ’s curiosity .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	Elizabeth had heard , soon after her arrival , that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks ; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ’s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seeing	The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	play	Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ” said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	employed	You have employed your time much better . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	began	Elizabeth immediately began playing again .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seen	It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something ; and in this emergency recollecting _ when _ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed,-- “ How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy !

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	told	But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ’s wishes , to be the case ; and , after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration , of her former favourite , George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s manners , she

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ’s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	walked	Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thinking	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ” said she . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ” said she . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	see	“ I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ’s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	continued	But , ” she continued , recollecting herself , “ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	trust	This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	doubted	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	attributed	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	exclaimed	“ To Jane herself , ” she exclaimed , “ there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thought	When she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ’s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	attend	The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	staying	seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ’s being rather displeased by her staying at home . CHAPTER XXXIV . When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .

CHAPTER XXXIV . When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	noticed	Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . She could not think of Darcy ’s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and , agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	answered	She answered him with cold civility . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	allow	You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	stared	She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	coloured	She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	lost	In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ’s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	tried	She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	see	As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believe	Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther ; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said,-- “ In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	have	You know I have . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	pronounced	Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ” As she pronounced these words , Mr. Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued,-- “ I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	continued	“ But it is not merely this affair , ” she continued , “ on which my dislike is founded . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	received	Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	cried	“ Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him ? ” “ His misfortunes ! ” repeated Darcy , contemptuously,--“yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ” “ And of your infliction , ” cried Elizabeth , with energy ; “ You have reduced him to his present state of poverty -- comparative poverty . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,-- “ You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ” She saw him start at this ; but he said nothing , and she continued,-- “ You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	went	She went on,-- “ From the very beginning , from the first moment , I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ” And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	recover	She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened : it was impossible to think of anything else ; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	passed	The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	passed	The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	caught	She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park : he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	retreating	, she was directly retreating . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	turned	She had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	began	Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	write	I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	know	You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	detached	The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	hope	But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	say	If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seen	I had often seen him in love before . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	perceive	From that moment I observed my friend ’s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	witnessed	From that moment I observed my friend ’s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	watched	Your sister I also watched . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	remained	Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and I remained convinced , from the evening ’s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	scruple	But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	venture	That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believe	I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	blame	I can not blame myself for having done thus much . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	reflect	There is but one part of my conduct , in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ’s being in town . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	knew	I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	have	On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wounded	If I have wounded your sister ’s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	refute	, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	summon	Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	began	As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	give	Here again I shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wished	I rather wished than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	knew	I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thought	I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believe	In town , I believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence ; and being 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	help	Mr. Wickham ’s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	hope	This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	know	I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	appeal	For the truth of everything here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ’s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	endeavour	If your abhorrence of _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	formed	Elizabeth , when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	began	With a strong prejudice against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	read	She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension ; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	resolved	His belief of her sister ’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	made	His belief of her sister ’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	read	But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham -- when she read , with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself -- her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wished	She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , “ This must be false ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	look	when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	known	The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	came	So far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	recalled	What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory ; and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other , and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	read	Again she read on . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy ’s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	tried	She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years ’ continuance .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	received	the story which followed , of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	remembered	She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips ’s . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	struck	She was _ now _ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	remembered	She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country , but that _ he _ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	remembered	She remembered , also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy ’s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believed	His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive : he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible . She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	knew	Till this moment , I never knew myself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	read	From herself to Jane , from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy ’s explanation _ there _ had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	deny	How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	help	He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ’s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ’s opinion had always been . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	deny	Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	She felt that Jane ’s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	came	When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in tones of such mortifying , yet merited , reproach , her sense of shame was severe . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	considered	It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ’s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	entered	After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought , reconsidering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seemed	Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits ; and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added,-- “ But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believe	And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ” “ You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believed	Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey ; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary -- which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	studied	She studied every sentence ; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	found	She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . CHAPTER XL . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	related	Elizabeth ’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself . Miss Bennet ’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , ” said she , “ and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	“ Indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , “ I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	paused	Miss Bennet paused a little , and then replied , “ Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	Miss Bennet paused a little , and then replied , “ Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	in	Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ And then , ” said she , “ if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	value	Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . “ Well , Lizzy , ” said Mrs. Bennet , one day , “ what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane ’s ?

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	lost	Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy ’s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	make	In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	help	As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her , were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	represented	She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia ’s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	left	At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	found	To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs. Gardiner ’s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found , from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	watched	Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ” said her uncle . “ There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ” replied her aunt ; “ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	tell	But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	excused	” Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could : said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and , therefore , gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ’s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	related	In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	set	Fatigued as she had been by the morning ’s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years ’ discontinuance . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	do	The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr. Darcy ’s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	settled	Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was , consequently , resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	recognizing	Elizabeth , immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	spoke	Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	retreated	She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	see	With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	found	She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ’s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wanted	She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre - possessed in her favour .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	long	Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	fancy	Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	turn	It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself ; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from _ hauteur _ or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seen	Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	turned	Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _ she _ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	ventured	Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	speak	Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	stayed	Eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner ’s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	lay	As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _ one _ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	known	He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance ; and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	help	Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ’s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	spoke	No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ’s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr. Darcy

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	spoke	While she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	giving	Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ’s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	attributed	To no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	feared	Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair ; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	remained	Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	cried	“ Do you really think so ? ” cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	give	Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ” “ Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	“ But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ” “ It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , “ that a sister ’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	doing	Perhaps I am not doing her justice . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	call	She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	do	But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	do	“ I do , indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , colouring . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	“ I do , indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , colouring . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	told	“ I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	returned	And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ’s time . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	related	As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	remember	I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	jumped	The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . Elizabeth jumped out ; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running downstairs from her mother ’s apartment ,

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	cried	“ But you -- how are you ? ” cried Elizabeth . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	lifted	But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ” Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , “ Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ” Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	availed	In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	considered	After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject by saying , “ But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	cried	“ Oh , Jane , ” cried Elizabeth , “ was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? ” “ I do not know : I hope there was . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	cried	She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . ” “ She had better have stayed at home , ” cried Elizabeth : “ perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one ’s neighbours . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	proceeded	She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believed	Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ’s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when , if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	tell	But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	heard	She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	feel	It was as follows:-- / * “ My dear Sir , * / “ I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	sympathize	Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	related	And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	advise	Let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	received	Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	known	The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _ that_,--though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ’s infamy somewhat better . It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	“ You must not be too severe upon yourself , ” replied Elizabeth . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	feel	No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	walking	Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	like	“ What is there of good to be expected ? ” said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; “ but perhaps you would like to read it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	caught	Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	conclude	If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness , nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	depended	There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister ’s frailty would have mortified her so much . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wonder	From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	assured	The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	repented	She was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	became	She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wanted	She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thought	What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	spurned	What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	began	She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	conjecture	But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	urged	But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ’s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	consulted	Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme ; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	Their sister ’s wedding - day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	sat	Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	blushed	_ She _ blushed , and Jane blushed ; but

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	joined	She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ’s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- “ Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thank	“ I thank you for my share of the favour , ” said Elizabeth ; “ but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	expected	Wickham ’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ’s for him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	needed	She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	know	I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	hear	However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	suppose	However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	longed	I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thought	“ Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	believe	If you ’ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	put	If you ’ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	know	Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	recollected	However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	repeated	“ Mr. Darcy ! ” repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	forgot	I quite forgot ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	promised	I promised them so faithfully ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ Oh , certainly , ” said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; “ we will ask you no questions . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	did	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	tell	It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	feared	The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced , of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ’s match -- which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation -- were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations ; and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . Brother - in - law of Wickham ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	place	It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could perhaps believe , that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	read	She read over her aunt ’s commendation of him again and again . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	strike	She was roused from her seat and her reflections , by someone ’s approach ; and , before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	“ I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ” said he , as he joined her . “ You certainly do , ” she replied with a smile ; “ but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	replied	She replied in the affirmative . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	hoped	Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said,-- “ I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	know	Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people ’s remarks . ” Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seen	Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend ’s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thought	“ Yet it is hard , ” she sometimes thought , “ that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	leave	I _ will _ leave him to himself . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seen	They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	went	Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . “ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ” said Kitty ; “ who can it be ? ”

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	suppose	“ Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner ’s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	expected	Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seen	Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	answer	Darcy , after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did -- a question which she could not answer without confusion -- said scarcely anything . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seated	He was not seated by her : perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	raised	But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	expect	“ Could I expect it to be otherwise ? ” said she . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ Could I expect it to be otherwise ? ” said she . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	do	She inquired after his sister , but could do no more . “ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ” said Mrs. Bennet . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	keep	Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy , was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	asked	It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	felt	At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion . “ The first wish of my heart , ” said she to herself , “ is never more to be in company with either of them .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	see	Let me never see either one or the other again ! ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	walked	As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or , in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more . Mr. Darcy ’s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , ” said she , “ did he come at all ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	settle	She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . “ He could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	I will think no more about him . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ Yes , very indifferent , indeed , ” said Elizabeth , laughingly . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	“ Oh , Jane ! take care . ” “ My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	“ I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	watched	When they repaired to the dining - room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	looked	Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	imagined	He bore it with noble indifference ; and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	knew	She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	see	She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse ; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	given	Her mother ’s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ’s mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	looked	She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ If he does not come to me , _ then _ , ” said she , “ I shall give him up for ever . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	give	“ If he does not come to me , _ then _ , ” said she , “ I shall give him up for ever . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	thought	The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	pouring	the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	followed	She followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee , and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! “ A man who has once been refused ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	envied	She followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee , and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! “ A man who has once been refused ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	seized	There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . ” She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee - cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying,-- “ Is your sister at Pemberley still ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	hoping	When the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose ; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ’s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	lost	She now lost every expectation of pleasure . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	They were confined for the evening at different tables ; and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was , unluckily , ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	said	“ Well , girls , ” said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , “ what say you to the day ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	I think everything has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	suppose	The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ’ last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	saw	And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	asked	Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	pay	While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ?

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	recollected	but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of Bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	forgotten	She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	knew	She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	guess	Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	refused	She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _ did _ call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her Ladyship ’s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _ she _ had refused to give .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	have	But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	answered	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	supposed	You supposed more than really existed .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	received	The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	wish	The letter was to this effect:-- / * “ My dear Lizzy , * / “ I wish you joy .

Elizabeth Bennet	agent	think	I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	had	As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	endeavoured	As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . 
Elizabeth Bennet	agent	retained	His affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	obliged	Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	admired	Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so ; but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	liked	Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so ; but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	answering	“ Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	mortified	“ That is very true , ” replied Elizabeth , “ and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	provoking	_ ] ] On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said,-- “ Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? ” “ With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ” “ You are severe on us . ” “ It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , ” said Miss Lucas . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	listened	Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began:-- “ What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seeing	“ You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	injured	Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,-- “ I can guess the subject of your reverie . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	“ Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	wish	and pray when am I to wish you joy ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	attended	She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	finding	In Meryton they parted : the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ’ wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles , with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	shown	She was shown into the breakfast parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	held	That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	received	She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ’s manners there was something better than politeness -- there was good - humour and kindness . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	summoned	At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half - past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	restored	The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane , when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	considered	they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	abusing	When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recommend	Mrs. Hurst thought the same , and added,-- “ She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	amuse	On entering the drawing - room , she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high , she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself , for the short time she could stay below , with a book . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	fetch	He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	suit	Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	advise	“ But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	stationed	Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and , soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	form	In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	moving	Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	understand	“ Oh yes -- I understand you perfectly . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	suffered	“ Lizzy , ” cried her mother , “ remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ” “ I did not know before , ” continued Bingley , immediately , “ that you were a studier of character . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	“ I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seated	seated herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	disliked	She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man , and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pain	The supposition did not pain her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	despise	I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all ; and now despise me if you dare . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	left	Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuade	In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said,-- “ Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	She was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	admire	“ You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ’s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	divert	Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	“ I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuade	The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	elevate	wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _ now _ escape him -- nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that , if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	see	Miss Bingley ’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	embracing	Miss Bingley ’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	struck	Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	succeeded	Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	liked	Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	given	He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham , and of what he had told her , 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	“ I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , ” said he , “ that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pleased	She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	struck	It now first struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	selected	It now first struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	gratified	The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	gave	The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her _ . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	alarmed	The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth ; and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ’s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	provoked	She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill - humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	formed	But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and , having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	took	When those dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	left	He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	console	: Charlotte tried to console her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	claim	When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her , in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	cautioning	When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her , in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	arrived	Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . “ Very well ; that reply will do for the present . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	gratifying	“ Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	“ I must not decide on my own performance . ” He made no answer ; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	blaming	A deeper shade of _ hauteur _ overspread his features , but he said not a word ; and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy ’s steward . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recommend	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pity	I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	; “ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	informed	; “ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	influence	“ You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	“ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity , ” said Elizabeth warmly , “ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	“ I have no reason , I assure you , ” said he , “ to be dissatisfied with my reception . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	vexed	When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	scolded	Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recommend	You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	teased	She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side ; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	He assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . There was no arguing upon such a project . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	finding	On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words,-- “ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	excuse	Mr. Collins must excuse me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	know	Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	done	I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	consider	Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ” “ You are uniformly charming ! ” cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; “ and I am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pass	Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs. Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	force	If , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	have	Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	Tell	Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	called	“ Let her be called down . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	summoned	Mrs. Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	threatened	She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	avoid	As for the gentleman himself , _ his _ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	invited	than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	follow	than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	surprised	Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley ’s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . “ It is unlucky , ” said she , after a short pause , “ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	marry	“ I see what you are feeling , ” replied Charlotte ; “ you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	left	Charlotte did not stay much longer ; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	authorized	Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	marry	Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	put	Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	used	Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	appease	Nothing could console and nothing appease her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	wear	Nor did that day wear out her resentment . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	see	A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her : a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude ; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	scolding	A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her : a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude ; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	oblige	“ To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuaded	“ To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuade	You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	Stop	Stop me , whilst you can . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convince	Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	jilt	He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ” “ Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	befall	“ True , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	laughed	It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ” But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	telling	Mrs. Gardiner ’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone : after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on:-- “ You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	involve	Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	engage	“ My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . ” “ Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth , having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	affected	Thursday was to be the wedding - day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister ’s being in town . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	reminded	Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	relinquish	The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte ’s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and , while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	take	March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	miss	The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	reminding	His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .

Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	detained	She saw instantly that her cousin ’s manners were not altered by his marriage : his formal civility was just what it had been ; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	prepared	Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect , and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	honoured	She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	include	I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	I will not tell you what it is . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	fail	When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ’s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . Elizabeth ’s courage did not fail her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seated	Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	furnish	Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	hear	“ Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	taken	Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	left	“ Has your governess left you ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	thank	Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	called	As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ’s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	amused	Elizabeth had heard , soon after her arrival , that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks ; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ’s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	meet	She was perfectly sensible that he never had : but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	telling	What are you telling Miss Bennet ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson ’s room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	reminded	When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	frighten	Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile , and said,-- “ You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	intimidate	My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	mistaken	“ I shall not say that you are mistaken , ” he replied , “ because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pass	I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	give	Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	employed	You have employed your time much better . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	startled	Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	putting	As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine ; and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter , that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy , and Mr. Darcy only , entered the room . He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologized for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologized for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	reminded	It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration , of her former favourite , George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s manners , she 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend Eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out : she watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	admired	He was , beyond comparison , the pleasantest man : he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	struck	He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins ’s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _ there _ too . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	distressed	It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	find	It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	engaged	She was engaged one day , as she walked , in re - perusing Jane ’s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy , she saw , on looking up , that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recovering	“ Is this , ” thought Elizabeth , “ meant for me ? ” and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , “ And pray , what is the usual price of an earl ’s younger son ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	answered	He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	watching	After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	telling	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ” said she . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recollecting	But , ” she continued , recollecting herself , “ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	trust	This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	connected	It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	When she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ’s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	attend	The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	press	seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ’s being rather displeased by her staying at home . CHAPTER XXXIV . When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	roused	While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door - bell ; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to inquire particularly after her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	love	You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	compose	She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	insulting	“ I might as well inquire , ” replied she , “ why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tempt	Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ” As she pronounced these words , Mr. Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued,-- “ I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	interrupt	Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ” As she pronounced these words , Mr. Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued,-- “ I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	conciliate	Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	affected	Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,-- “ You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ” She saw him start at this ; but he said nothing , and she continued,-- “ You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	impressing	She went on,-- “ From the very beginning , from the first moment , I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	support	She knew not how to support herself , and , from actual weakness , sat down and cried for half an hour . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	marry	so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ’s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	hurried	She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ’s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	indulge	She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened : it was impossible to think of anything else ; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	stopped	She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr. Darcy ’s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	led	She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr. Darcy ’s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	continuing	She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park : he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	see	But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	humbling	I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	made	, I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ’s accidental information , that Bingley ’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	misled	If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pains	The situation of your mother ’s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	led	I will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	preserve	I will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pointing	We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	blame	I can not blame myself for having done thus much . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	governed	If I have wounded your sister ’s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	accused	Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	prevent	But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	survive	His own father did not long survive mine ; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	blame	You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	forget	I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	induce	I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	acquit	This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuaded	With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	satisfied	He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	oppressed	Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	collecting	in half a minute the letter was unfolded again ; and collecting herself as well as she could 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	commanded	, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	flattered	What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory ; and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other , and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	forced	But when she read and re - read , with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ’s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	shocked	The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham ’s charge exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	befriended	But no such recollection befriended her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	referred	the story which followed , of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	escaped	She was _ now _ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	She remembered , also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy ’s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	prided	“ I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	valued	I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	gratified	I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	knew	Till this moment , I never knew myself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	obliged	How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	struck	The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	console	It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ’s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	reconciling	After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought , reconsidering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	found	She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	presented	Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her Ladyship ’s indignation would have been . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	amused	how would she have behaved ? ” were the questions with which she amused herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	obliged	“ I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ but it is not in my power to accept it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	replied	“ I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ but it is not in my power to accept it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	passed	Mr. Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,-- “ It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	introduce	We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	attended	After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins ; and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , though unknown .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	handed	He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	shocked	Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _ expression _ herself , the coarseness of the _ sentiment _ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	plague	In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	grieved	She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ’s refusal must have given him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	blame	You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ” “ Blame you ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	Blame	You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ” “ Blame you ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	blame	“ But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	“ But you _ will _ know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . ” She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	inclined	For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy ’s , but you shall do as you choose . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	wanted	Oh , how I wanted you ! ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	valued	relate the other half of Mr. Darcy ’s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	accompany	But the gloom of Lydia ’s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recommended	A resemblance in good - humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their _ three _ months ’ acquaintance they had been intimate _ two _ . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	make	As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her , were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	heard	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	forced	At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	delighted	She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	provoke	, moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure ; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but , with a moment ’s recollection , and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	escape	“ Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . ” “ Indeed ! ” cried Wickham , with a look which did not escape her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	engage	She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	distinguish	The rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	promised	Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	console	It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	make	Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	perceiving	“ But surely , ” said she , “ I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars , without his perceiving me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	applied	Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tired	She must own that she was tired of great houses : after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	applied	A most welcome negative followed the last question ; and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	followed	They followed her into the dining - parlour . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	acquainted	With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recollecting	But , no , ” recollecting herself , “ that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	allowed	But , no , ” recollecting herself , “ that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	saved	This was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	called	Her aunt now called her to look at a picture . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantel - piece . Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	encouraged	Mr. Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks : Mrs. Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . “ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	interest	Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	arrested	At last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	overpowered	She was overpowered by shame and vexation . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seeing	Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seen	Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	roused	At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	construed	when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	gratified	Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	love	It is impossible that he should still love me . ” After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	He then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	excused	” Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could : said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	leave	The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr. Darcy ’s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	visit	Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was , consequently , resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	fail	more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	compose	She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ’s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	express	They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ’s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seeing	All Elizabeth ’s anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pleased	Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	deceived	But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival to Jane . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	ask	Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _ all _ her sisters were at Longbourn . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself ; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from _ hauteur _ or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seeing	Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour ; and when they arose to depart , Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seeing	Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	found	Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	loved	It was gratitude;--gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	avoid	He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance ; and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	watched	Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her .

This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	roused	After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ’s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	remind	The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	exerting	In Darcy ’s presence she dared not mention Wickham ’s name : but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ’s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	discompose	Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ’s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	reached	Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ’s meditated elopement . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	grown	She is grown so brown and coarse ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	known	Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	admired	Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	knew	He was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued,-- “ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	knew	“ Yes , ” replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , “ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	considered	“ Yes , ” replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , “ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	leaving	They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	alarming	It was to this effect:-- “ Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	spared	I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	begging	I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	detain	what is the matter ? ” cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , “ I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	support	On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , “ Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ?

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recover	“ No , I thank you , ” she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	distressed	I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	observe	Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	engross	But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	lost	Lydia -- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all -- soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said,-- “ I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	torment	But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	seeing	This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	found	An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr. Gardiner , meanwhile , having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	prepared	From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	met	immediately met her 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	Her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children , 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	availed	In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	informs	And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	leads	And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	warn	“ You may well warn me against such an evil . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	said	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ” said Elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	received	Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	mortified	There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister ’s frailty would have mortified her so much . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	humbled	She was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	But I must tell you how it went off . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	believe	If you ’ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	give	Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	Thank	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pleased	Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	“ Not that I _ shall _ , though , ” she added to herself , and she finished the letter ; “ and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ”

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	convinced	She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	_ He _ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she stayed with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ’s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	recollected	I was sometimes quite provoked ; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	threw	The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	doing	The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced , of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ’s match -- which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation -- were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	place	It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could perhaps believe , that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pleased	It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuaded	She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	roused	She was roused from her seat and her reflections , by someone ’s approach ; and , before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	overtaken	She was roused from her seat and her reflections , by someone ’s approach ; and , before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	joined	“ I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ” said he , as he joined her . “ You certainly do , ” she replied with a smile ; “ but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	said	I wonder what he can be doing there . ” “ Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , ” said Elizabeth . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	said	“ This is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , ” said Elizabeth . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	denied	You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuaded	Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , everything , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	vexed	As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or , in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more . Mr. Darcy ’s behaviour astonished and vexed her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	fears	If he fears me , why come hither ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	joined	Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuaded	His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that , if left wholly to himself , Jane ’s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	revived	There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . ” She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee - cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying,-- “ Is your sister at Pemberley still ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	suspect	You must not suspect me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	mortifies	It mortifies me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assure	I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuade	But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	observe	Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , “ What is the matter , mamma ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	forced	Elizabeth was forced to go . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	embracing	Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	joined	In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	expressed	Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	vex	It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ’s pretended regard . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	see	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	have	Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	mentioned	had mentioned her name to her mother on her Ladyship ’s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	received	Mrs. Bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	see	“ Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , ” said Elizabeth coolly , “ will be rather a confirmation of it -- if , indeed , such a report is in existence . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	entitled	“ But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	induce	“ But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	have	Now , what have you to say ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	lost	Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	brought	If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	deceive	But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	concern	How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	marrying	And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	persuade	Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her Ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	met	Her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing - room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	forced	Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	threw	The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	regretting	If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . ” The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great : but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet ’s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject . The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .

Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	“ Lizzy , ” said he , “ I was going to look for you : come into my room . ” She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	struck	It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine , and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	concerns	As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	congratulate	Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	inclined	Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ’s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ’ 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	cautioning	‘ My motive for cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ’ 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	surprised	Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	rejoiced	Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ‘ I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ’s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	diverted	“ Oh , ” cried Elizabeth , “ I am exceedingly diverted . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	forced	Elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	told	Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him : but though she could not look she could listen ; and he told her of feelings which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	decided	I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	checked	Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	deceive	No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	believe	My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	loves	He still loves me , and we are engaged . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	seriously , assured her of its truth . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	believe	Yet now I must believe you , ” cried Jane . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	congratulate	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	advise	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	followed	As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- “ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	forced	As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- “ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	put	It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ” During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet ’s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ’s . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	pain	You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	give	I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	advise	But let me advise you to think better of it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	know	I know your disposition , Lizzy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	place	Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	heard	He heard her with astonishment . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	bless	Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard , though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	bless	Lord bless me ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	followed	But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	assured	But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	admire	Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	disgusted	You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	interested	I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	hated	Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	disguise	Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	courted	in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asking	My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	left	But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	asked	I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	thanking	My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	distress	“ You need not distress yourself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	tell	But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	see	or had you intended any more serious consequences ? ” “ My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	love	ever hope to make you love me 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	write	“ And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	thanked	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	thank	I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	acquainted	He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	given	His affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	bringing	Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	advise	I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . 
Elizabeth Bennet	patient	favour	I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	danced	Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	sharpened	Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	see	Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	walked	Mr. Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	talked	If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	know	You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ” Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley ’s attention to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty : he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	stood	Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began:-- “ What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy !

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	engrossed	Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr. Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who , when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	made	The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each . “ How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! ” He made no answer . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	write	“ You write uncommonly fast . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	write	“ That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , ” cried her brother , “ because he does _ not _ write with ease .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	convinced	“ I daresay you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	know	Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ‘ Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ’ you would probably do it -- you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	consider	“ Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	speaking	I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	has	I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	know	They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	attempt	As for your Elizabeth ’s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	felt	Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said,-- “ This walk is not wide enough for our party . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	advanced	They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley ’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	addressed	He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was “ very glad ; ” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley ’s salutation .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	looked	succeeded no less in the real object of her civility : Mr. Darcy looked up .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	means	“ Not at all , ” was her answer ; “ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	forget	I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	chosen	But you have chosen your fault well . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	believe	“ There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . ” “ And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	began	He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	liked	She attracted him more than he liked ; and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _ her _ and more teasing than usual to himself .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	corroborated	Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger ; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	deigned	Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	staying	He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	spoken	You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	chooses	The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . ” “ I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . ” Wickham only shook his head . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	going	“ I do not at all know ; but I _ heard _ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	seek	Why did not you seek legal redress ? ” “ There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	chose	A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	hates	But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	liked	Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	having	After a few minutes ’ reflection , however , she continued , “ I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	esteemed	He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	acknowledged	Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	endured	The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	contradict	If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	addressed	When those dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	approached	When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her , in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	heard	The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed , with a very serious expression , towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	using	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	bear	I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	excuse	“ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity , ” said Elizabeth warmly , “ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	consider	Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr. Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	overheard	In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ’s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy , who sat opposite to them . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	like	I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	looking	She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	said	Darcy said nothing at all . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	suffer	“ And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	enter	Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	spoken	On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy ’s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ’s reputed disposition , when quite a lad , which might agree with it ; and was confident , at last , that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .

On the very last day of the regiment ’s remaining in Meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s and Mr. Darcy ’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	told	Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy , the gardener ’s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	thought	She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	felt	Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	has	“ To be sure , Lizzy , ” said her aunt , “ he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ’s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	change	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	behaved	“ From what we have seen of him , ” continued Mrs. Gardiner , “ I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	has	He has not an ill - natured look . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	wishing	The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr. Darcy ’s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	bring	Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was , consequently , resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	told	They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ’s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	called	Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour ; and when they arose to depart , Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	had	They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	quitting	With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well - known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	entering	While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	appear	No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ’s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr. Darcy

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	attending	Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth ’s person , behaviour , and dress .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	replied	“ Yes , ” replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , “ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	appeared	where , where is my uncle ? ” cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr. Darcy appeared . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	leave	On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , “ Let me call your maid .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	entered	When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	distinguished	Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	acquainted	Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	connect	Had Lydia ’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	arrived	It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	collect	From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	suppose	She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	asked	Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	came	Everything being settled between _ them _ , Mr. Darcy ’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	found	But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen ; and Mr. Darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	said	Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	saw	They met again on Sunday , and then _ I _ saw him too . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	speak	Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	believe	But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	suppose	You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	given	The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	talked	I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	recollected	I was sometimes quite provoked ; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	feel	It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could perhaps believe , that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	looked	He looked serious as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	looking	Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	said	Darcy , after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did -- a question which she could not answer without confusion -- said scarcely anything .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	bringing	There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . ” She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee - cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying,-- “ Is your sister at Pemberley still ? ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	doing	Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and , perhaps , he might be doing the same .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	hope	“ The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	hear	She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	appeared	She did not fear her father ’s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means ; that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	approached	In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , “ Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	made	“ I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	thanked	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	married	But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	laugh	I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	sends	Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	exposed	At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	agent	assisted	Though Darcy could never receive _ him _ at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ’s sake , he assisted him further in his profession . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	introduce	Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	tempt	and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till , catching her eye , he withdrew his own , and coldly said , “ She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	asked	“ Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	eat	But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	forced	Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	mistook	“ You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	used	“ I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , ” said Darcy . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	convinced	“ I daresay you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	liked	She liked him too little to care for his approbation . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	heard	“ Oh , ” said she , “ I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	provoke	Miss Bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	grouped	You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	addressed	He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was “ very glad ; ” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley ’s salutation . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	assured	She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	stretch	Mr. Hurst had , therefore , nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	win	She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question and read on . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	mean	“ If you mean Darcy , ” cried her brother , “ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	understand	She was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	disappointing	“ Not at all , ” was her answer ; “ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	disappointing	Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	punish	How shall we punish him for such a speech ? ” “ Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ” said Elizabeth . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	Tease	Tease him -- laugh at him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	assure	I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	hug	Mr. Darcy may hug himself . ” “ Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! ” cried Elizabeth . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	attracted	She attracted him more than he liked ; and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _ her _ and more teasing than usual to himself . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	escape	wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _ now _ escape him -- nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that , if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	known	I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	liked	He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	estimated	“ I can not pretend to be sorry , ” said Wickham , after a short interruption , “ that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _ him _ 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	sees	The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . ” “ I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . ” Wickham only shook his head .

His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	liked	“ I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	connected	It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	led	“ Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? ” “ Yes ; it has often led him to be liberal and generous ; to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	deserts	His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	places	My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father ’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	accepted	When those dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	oblige	They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and , at first , was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	addressed	After a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time , with-- “ It is _ your _ turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	perceiving	At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but , on perceiving Mr. Darcy , he stopped , with a bow of superior courtesy , to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . “ I have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir ; such very superior dancing is not often seen . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	disgrace	Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you : and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) , shall take place . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	interrupt	I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you , sir . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	detaining	You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ” [ Illustration : “ Such very superior dancing is not often seen . ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	strike	The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed , with a very serious expression , towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	treated	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	including	I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .

His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	considering	I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	accuse	; “ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	offended	Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	lose	I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’s regard . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	attack	Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ; ” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	offend	What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	escaped	To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	disliked	The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	condemned	Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	cleanse	Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	known	They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ’s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	involve	Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	destined	Elizabeth had heard , soon after her arrival , that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks ; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ’s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	seen	seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	answered	She answered him in the usual way ; and , after a moment ’s pause , added,-- “ My eldest sister has been in town these three months . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	stationed	Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ’s countenance . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	teach	Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , “ Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	pain	I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	recommend	“ Perhaps , ” said Darcy , “ I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	seen	It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something ; and in this emergency recollecting _ when _ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed,-- “ How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	thank	“ Perfectly so , I thank you . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	occasioned	Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and , after sitting a few minutes longer , without saying much to anybody , went away . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	meet	More than once did Elizabeth , in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	please	“ And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	told	“ He only told me what I have now told you . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	condemn	But , ” she continued , recollecting herself , “ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	concerned	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	mislead	If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _ he _ was the cause -- his pride and caprice were the cause -- of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	see	The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	answered	She answered him with cold civility . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	recommend	His sense of her inferiority , of its being a degradation , of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	answer	She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	thank	It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	rejected	I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at civility , I am thus rejected . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	defend	In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	hold	This is the estimation in which you hold me ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	stopping	But , perhaps , ” added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , “ these offences might have been 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	congratulate	Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	seeing	She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country , but that _ he _ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	sinking	She remembered , also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy ’s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	upbraided	When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation : but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	approve	His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect : but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	see	His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect : but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	given	She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ’s refusal must have given him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	refusing	You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ” “ Blame you ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	ruin	To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	pardon	She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy ’s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	meeting	The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	know	“ Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	represented	Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character ; and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before : she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs ; and , taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	call	I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _ I _ have seen nothing of it . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	take	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	join	Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour ; and when they arose to depart , Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	known	They could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant ’s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	known	There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant , who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	accuse	They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	held	With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well - known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	hate	She certainly did not hate him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	rejecting	It was gratitude;--gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	left	He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	contented	However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	contain	“ Yes , ” replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , “ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	forced	He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	thank	“ No , I thank you , ” she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	fixed	Darcy was fixed in astonishment . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	loved	It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	told	“ Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	admire	When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	connect	Had Lydia ’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	confess	I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _ you _ . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	understand	Do n’t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	forgive	Do n’t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	tell	It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	heard	If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	like	Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	please	His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	teach	His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	exclude	Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	wanting	The children have been wanting me this half hour . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	reduced	He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	refused	But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations ; and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . Brother - in - law of Wickham ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	see	Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said,-- “ I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	take	“ It must be something particular to take him there at this time of year . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	see	Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	saw	Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . “ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ” said Kitty ; “ who can it be ? ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	used	He looked serious as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	seen	He looked serious as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	received	He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	gone	His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the Regulars . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	owed	Her mother ’s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ’s mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	give	“ If he does not come to me , _ then _ , ” said she , “ I shall give him up for ever . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	followed	She followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee , and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! “ A man who has once been refused ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	injure	Though I _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	accept	And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	attached	Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	bring	as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ’s visit . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	wounding	Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed ; and while her courage was high , she immediately said,-- “ Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	thanking	I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	informed	“ I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , ” replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , “ that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	concerned	Lydia ’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	thank	Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	induced	Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	thank	“ If you _ will _ thank me , ” he replied , “ let it be for yourself alone . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	led	That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	hate	I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	convinced	“ When I wrote that letter , ” replied Darcy , “ I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	taught	I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	taught	I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	correct	I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	given	I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	spoiled	Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	humbled	By you , I was properly humbled . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	showed	You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	lead	I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	hated	How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	blamed	You blamed me for coming ? ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	told	My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	told	I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	told	I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	told	“ Did you speak from your own observation , ” said she , “ when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? ”

Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	dislike	I know how much you dislike him . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	love	Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	love	And do you really love him quite well enough ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	love	“ What do you mean ? ” “ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	loved	Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	esteemed	Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ’s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	advise	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	follow	In the evening , soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	reconcile	Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ’ suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ’s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	told	To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	set	“ I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	praise	You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	love	If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	patient	assisted	Though Darcy could never receive _ him _ at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ’s sake , he assisted him further in his profession . 
Jane Bennet	agent	looked	Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . 
Jane Bennet	agent	going	I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 
Jane Bennet	agent	admired	When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ He is just what a young - man ought to be , ” said she , “ sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! ” “ He is also handsome , ” replied Elizabeth , “ which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can .

Jane Bennet	agent	Did	“ Did not you ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	liked	You have liked many a stupider person . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	know	“ Dear Lizzy ! ” “ Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . 
Jane Bennet	agent	see	You never see a fault in anybody .

Jane Bennet	agent	saw	“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ Miss Bingley told me , ” said Jane , “ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 
Jane Bennet	agent	yielding	It was generally evident , whenever they met , that he _ did _ admire her ; and to _ her _ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .

Jane Bennet	agent	mentioned	She mentioned this to her friend , Miss Lucas . 
Jane Bennet	agent	command	Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 
Jane Bennet	agent	chooses	When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ” “ Your plan is a good one , ” replied Elizabeth , “ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . 
Jane Bennet	agent	acting	But these are not Jane ’s feelings ; she is not acting by design . 
Jane Bennet	agent	known	She has known him only a fortnight . 
Jane Bennet	agent	danced	She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .

Jane Bennet	agent	understand	This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	dined	Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and 
Jane Bennet	agent	had	“ Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ” “ Well , ” said Charlotte , “ I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ It is from Miss Bingley , ” said Jane , and then read it aloud . 
Jane Bennet	agent	read	“ It is from Miss Bingley , ” said Jane , and then read it aloud . 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ With the officers ! ” cried Lydia : “ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ” “ Dining out , ” said Mrs. Bennet ; “ that is very unlucky . ” “ Can I have the carriage ? ” said Jane . 
Jane Bennet	agent	come	The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back . 
Jane Bennet	agent	longed	Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , 
Jane Bennet	agent	testified	wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . 
Jane Bennet	agent	recovering	Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 
Jane Bennet	agent	felt	The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 
Jane Bennet	agent	caught	Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . 
Jane Bennet	agent	dropped	Why , Jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing ! 
Jane Bennet	agent	attempted	Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ Though it is difficult , ” said Jane , “ to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	defended	As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .

Jane Bennet	agent	settled	She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ’s two sisters . 
Jane Bennet	agent	marrying	It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and , lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .

Jane Bennet	agent	think	I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .

Jane Bennet	agent	shook	Jane shook her head . 
Jane Bennet	agent	imagine	But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”

CHAPTER XXII . 
Jane Bennet	agent	joined	Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .

Jane Bennet	agent	concluded	, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead .

Jane Bennet	agent	quitted	Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but , as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet .

Jane Bennet	agent	deceive	After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 
Jane Bennet	agent	wrote	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me .

Jane Bennet	agent	written	seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ’s being rather displeased by her staying at home . CHAPTER XXXIV . When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 
Jane Bennet	agent	questioned	Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that , proud and repulsive as were his manners 
Jane Bennet	agent	lost	Anxiety on Jane ’s behalf was another prevailing concern ; and Mr. Darcy ’s explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 
Jane Bennet	agent	appear	When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham ’s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .

Jane Bennet	agent	had	To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further . CHAPTER XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs . 
Jane Bennet	agent	remained	To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further .

Jane Bennet	agent	wanted	Oh , how I wanted you ! ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	encouraging	But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . 
Jane Bennet	agent	want	There is one point on which I want your advice . 
Jane Bennet	agent	want	I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ’s character . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	endeavour	On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	say	At present I will say nothing about it . ” “ You are quite right . 
Jane Bennet	agent	cherished	She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley . 
Jane Bennet	agent	saw	But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . 
Jane Bennet	agent	getting	Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 
Jane Bennet	agent	die	Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . 
Jane Bennet	agent	make	In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned . 
Jane Bennet	agent	written	Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 
Jane Bennet	agent	written	“ My father has gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ’s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . 
Jane Bennet	agent	think	” “ But you see that Jane , ” said her aunt , “ does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	think	“ Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	believe	And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	knows	But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . 
Jane Bennet	agent	thought	As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	replied	“ Not yet , ” replied Jane . 
Jane Bennet	agent	hope	“ But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	wrote	“ Is my father in town ? ” “ Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	heard	“ And have you heard from him often ? ” “ We have heard only once . 
Jane Bennet	agent	trust	“ My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . 
Jane Bennet	agent	look	“ You look pale . 
Jane Bennet	agent	ran	Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .

Jane Bennet	agent	had	When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give . 
Jane Bennet	agent	expected	The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage . 
Jane Bennet	agent	took	Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth .

Jane Bennet	agent	read	But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr. Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .

Jane Bennet	agent	heard	Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror . 
Jane Bennet	agent	cried	“ A gamester ! ” she cried . 
Jane Bennet	agent	had	“ This is wholly unexpected ; I had not an idea of it . 
Jane Bennet	agent	walking	Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	lagged	Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out,-- “ Oh , papa , what news ? what news ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	came	Jane now came up . 
Jane Bennet	agent	hoped	It is enough to know they are discovered : I have seen them both---- ” “ Then it is as I always hoped , ” cried Jane : “ they are married ! ” Elizabeth read on : “ I have seen them both .

Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ Let me write for you , ” said Jane , “ if you dislike the trouble yourself . ” “ I dislike it very much , ” he replied ; “ but it must be done . ” And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . 
Jane Bennet	agent	want	But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . 
Jane Bennet	agent	cried	my uncle ! ” cried Jane , “ what do you mean , sir ? ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	mean	“ I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	comfort	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 
Jane Bennet	agent	replied	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 
Jane Bennet	agent	believe	Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , ” said Jane : “ I hope and trust they will yet be happy .

Jane Bennet	agent	believe	His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 
Jane Bennet	agent	flatter	Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	read	As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner ’s hope of Lydia ’s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . 
Jane Bennet	agent	cried	“ My dear , dear Lydia ! ” she cried : “ this is delightful indeed ! 
Jane Bennet	agent	see	I shall see her again ! 
Jane Bennet	agent	knew	My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . 
Jane Bennet	agent	knew	My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . 
Jane Bennet	agent	long	How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! 
Jane Bennet	agent	write	I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . 
Jane Bennet	agent	go	Stay , stay , I will go myself . 
Jane Bennet	agent	put	I will put on my things in a moment . 
Jane Bennet	agent	persuaded	She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . One day ’s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .

Jane Bennet	agent	call	And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . 
Jane Bennet	agent	do	Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	urged	But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ’s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . 
Jane Bennet	agent	felt	Their sister ’s wedding - day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . 
Jane Bennet	agent	blushed	_ She _ blushed , and Jane blushed ; but 
Jane Bennet	agent	go	She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ’s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- “ Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ If it was to be a secret , ” said Jane , “ say not another word on the subject . 
Jane Bennet	agent	seeking	You may depend upon my seeking no further . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	speak	Jane ’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 
Jane Bennet	agent	begin	As the day of his arrival drew near,-- “ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ” said Jane to her sister . 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	As the day of his arrival drew near,-- “ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ” said Jane to her sister .

Jane Bennet	agent	vow	Mr. Darcy!--and so it does , I vow . 
Jane Bennet	agent	hate	say that I hate the very sight of him . 
Jane Bennet	agent	looked	Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . 
Jane Bennet	agent	knew	She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .

Jane Bennet	agent	suspected	But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner ’s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .

Jane Bennet	agent	refused	To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merits she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .

Jane Bennet	agent	known	Her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 
Jane Bennet	agent	thought	The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken ; but she would not be secure . 
Jane Bennet	agent	see	“ Let me first see how he behaves , ” said she ; “ it will then be early enough for expectation . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ Let me first see how he behaves , ” said she ; “ it will then be early enough for expectation . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	sat	She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door . 
Jane Bennet	agent	looked	Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected . 
Jane Bennet	agent	received	On the gentlemen ’s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . 
Jane Bennet	agent	amends	At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion . “ The first wish of my heart , ” said she to herself , “ is never more to be in company with either of them . 
Jane Bennet	agent	talked	When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days ’ time .

Jane Bennet	agent	did	Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . 
Jane Bennet	agent	think	And what do you think she said besides ? 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ” said Jane ; “ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . 
Jane Bennet	agent	dare	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ” said Jane ; “ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago .

Jane Bennet	agent	acknowledged	Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 
Jane Bennet	agent	look	It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . 
Jane Bennet	agent	talked	Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was . 
Jane Bennet	agent	went	Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 
Jane Bennet	agent	kissed	Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . 
Jane Bennet	agent	come	I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . 
Jane Bennet	agent	cared	At that moment she cared for no other . 
Jane Bennet	agent	found	Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else : but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 
Jane Bennet	agent	sought	In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 
Jane Bennet	agent	said	“ He has made me so happy , ” said she , one evening , “ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 
Jane Bennet	agent	believed	I had not believed it possible . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	wonder	They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . 
Jane Bennet	agent	trust	But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	had	Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 
Jane Bennet	agent	knew	Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 
Jane Bennet	agent	cried	“ I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! ” cried Jane . 
Jane Bennet	agent	see	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! 
Jane Bennet	agent	allowed	Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . 
Jane Bennet	agent	joking	“ You are joking , Lizzy . 
Jane Bennet	agent	deceive	No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	looked	Jane looked at her doubtingly . 
Jane Bennet	agent	know	I know how much you dislike him . ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	believe	Yet now I must believe you , ” cried Jane . 
Jane Bennet	agent	cried	Yet now I must believe you , ” cried Jane . 
Jane Bennet	agent	congratulate	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ” 
Jane Bennet	agent	want	I want to talk very seriously . 
Jane Bennet	agent	know	Let me know everything that I am to know without delay . 
Jane Bennet	agent	knew	Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . 
Jane Bennet	agent	remained	Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 
Jane Bennet	patient	felt	Elizabeth felt Jane ’s pleasure . 
Jane Bennet	patient	admire	I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . 
Jane Bennet	patient	asked	So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . 
Jane Bennet	patient	asking	“ I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . 
Jane Bennet	patient	take	Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . 
Jane Bennet	patient	asking	What could be more natural than his asking you again ? 
Jane Bennet	patient	mean	“ Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ” “ Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . 
Jane Bennet	patient	admired	To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her 
Jane Bennet	patient	told	“ Miss Bingley told me , ” said Jane , “ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . 
Jane Bennet	patient	admire	It was generally evident , whenever they met , that he _ did _ admire her ; and to _ her _ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .

Jane Bennet	patient	married	“ Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ” “ Well , ” said Charlotte , “ I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . 
Jane Bennet	patient	obliged	She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . 
Jane Bennet	patient	gone	Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . 
Jane Bennet	patient	see	“ I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	treated	She was not equal , however , to much conversation ; and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 
Jane Bennet	patient	attended	Elizabeth silently attended her . 
Jane Bennet	patient	visit	In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . 
Jane Bennet	patient	seeing	Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 
Jane Bennet	patient	remove	Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 
Jane Bennet	patient	urged	Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley ’s carriage immediately , and 
Jane Bennet	patient	laugh	“ Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . 
Jane Bennet	patient	gave	“ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . 
Jane Bennet	patient	married	When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley . 
Jane Bennet	patient	secure	She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane , with all possible mildness , declined interfering ; and 
Jane Bennet	patient	recollected	Jane recollected herself soon ; and putting the letter away , tried 
Jane Bennet	patient	surprised	When they had gained their own room , Jane , taking out her letter , said , “ This is from Caroline Bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal . 
Jane Bennet	patient	hurts	I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . 
Jane Bennet	patient	misleading	My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’s heart . 
Jane Bennet	patient	think	What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? ” said Jane , as she finished it . 
Jane Bennet	patient	put	Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . 
Jane Bennet	patient	persuade	She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	believe	“ Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . 
Jane Bennet	patient	tells	But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	advise	“ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ” “ You must decide for yourself , ” said Elizabeth ; “ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ” “ How can you talk so ? ” said Jane , faintly smiling ; “ you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ” “ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . ” “ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 
Jane Bennet	patient	led	She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane ’s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart . 
Jane Bennet	patient	thanking	Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . 
Jane Bennet	patient	confessed	Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match : but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 
Jane Bennet	patient	persuade	Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match : but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . 
Jane Bennet	patient	require	But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used . 
Jane Bennet	patient	threw	The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill - humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 
Jane Bennet	patient	regarded	As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . 
Jane Bennet	patient	turn	, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead . 
Jane Bennet	patient	forced	“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ” said she , “ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ” “ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 
Jane Bennet	patient	preserved	“ Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ” “ I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . 
Jane Bennet	patient	doubt	“ You doubt me , ” cried Jane , slightly colouring ; “ indeed , you have no reason . 
Jane Bennet	patient	loved	I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	set	_ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . 
Jane Bennet	patient	persuade	You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	convinced	“ I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , ” replied Jane ; “ and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . 
Jane Bennet	patient	misunderstand	I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 
Jane Bennet	patient	entreat	I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 
Jane Bennet	patient	pain	I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . 
Jane Bennet	patient	displease	But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . 
Jane Bennet	patient	known	They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . 
Jane Bennet	patient	distress	Do not distress me by the idea . 
Jane Bennet	patient	blame	“ I do not blame Jane , ” she continued , “ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . 
Jane Bennet	patient	influence	“ I hope , ” added Mrs. Gardiner , “ that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . 
Jane Bennet	patient	see	We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her 
Jane Bennet	patient	seeing	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ” But , in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 
Jane Bennet	patient	see	“ I did not think Caroline in spirits , ” were her words , “ but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 
Jane Bennet	patient	reproached	“ I did not think Caroline in spirits , ” were her words , “ but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . 
Jane Bennet	patient	persuade	She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ’s inattention . 
Jane Bennet	patient	deceive	After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer . 
Jane Bennet	patient	confess	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me . 
Jane Bennet	patient	think	But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . 
Jane Bennet	patient	see	did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . 
Jane Bennet	patient	help	I pity , though I can not help blaming , her . 
Jane Bennet	patient	singling	She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 
Jane Bennet	patient	pity	But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 
Jane Bennet	patient	explain	I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . 
Jane Bennet	patient	persuade	He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 
Jane Bennet	patient	duped	I am sure you will be very comfortable there . “ Yours , etc . ” This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned , as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . 
Jane Bennet	patient	seen	On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . 
Jane Bennet	patient	support	Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . 
Jane Bennet	patient	separate	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 
Jane Bennet	patient	studying	Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . 
Jane Bennet	patient	astonish	To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further . CHAPTER XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs . 
Jane Bennet	patient	see	Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,---- “ I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	acquaint	Elizabeth ’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself . Miss Bennet ’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .

Miss Bennet ’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . 
Jane Bennet	patient	consoling	Nor was Darcy ’s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . 
Jane Bennet	patient	shocked	“ I do not know when I have been more shocked , ” said she . 
Jane Bennet	patient	comfort	And with no one to speak to of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me , and say that I had not been so very weak , and vain , and nonsensical , as I knew I had ! 
Jane Bennet	patient	authorized	Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . 
Jane Bennet	patient	believe	On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? 
Jane Bennet	patient	known	Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters . 
Jane Bennet	patient	included	Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts : it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . “ But it is fortunate , ” thought she , “ that I have something to wish for . 
Jane Bennet	patient	adapted	The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . 
Jane Bennet	patient	seeing	On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it “ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ” and , before she could reply , he added , “ It is above eight months . 
Jane Bennet	patient	distinguished	Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .

Jane Bennet	patient	wearied	It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations . 
Jane Bennet	patient	embraced	Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives . 
Jane Bennet	patient	seeing	She is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . 
Jane Bennet	patient	deserted	The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage . 
Jane Bennet	patient	comfort	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 
Jane Bennet	patient	flatter	Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	disturbed	She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . 
Jane Bennet	patient	dressed	“ I will go to Meryton , ” said she , “ as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . 
Jane Bennet	patient	attended	Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets -- and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . 
Jane Bennet	patient	recollected	I was sometimes quite provoked ; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . 
Jane Bennet	patient	regarded	To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merits she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley . 
Jane Bennet	patient	seeking	Her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire . 
Jane Bennet	patient	prevailed	But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 
Jane Bennet	patient	congratulate	Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said,-- “ Jane , I congratulate you . 
Jane Bennet	patient	settled	“ You are a good girl , ” he replied , “ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 
Jane Bennet	patient	cheat	You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ” “ I hope not so . 
Jane Bennet	patient	telling	“ He has made me so happy , ” said she , one evening , “ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 
Jane Bennet	patient	loved	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ” “ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	prejudice	Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 
Jane Bennet	patient	singled	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! 
Jane Bennet	patient	tell	Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ” 
Jane Bennet	patient	satisfied	Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . 
Jane Bennet	patient	deceived	Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .

William Collins	agent	seemed	Mr. Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . 
William Collins	agent	complimented	He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .

William Collins	agent	read	By tea - time , however , the dose had been enough , and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him [ Illustration : “ Protested that he never read novels ” H.T Feb 94 ] to read aloud to the ladies .

William Collins	agent	offered	Then , turning to Mr. Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . 
William Collins	agent	acted	Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . 
William Collins	agent	bore	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia ’s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr. Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for backgammon . 
William Collins	agent	belonged	Mr. Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 
William Collins	agent	intended	Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .

William Collins	agent	thought	This was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father ’s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . His plan did not vary on seeing them . 
William Collins	agent	fixed	The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ’s _ tête - à - tête _ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on .

William Collins	agent	followed	Lydia ’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten : every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .

William Collins	agent	walked	She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows .

William Collins	agent	gratified	Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips ’s manners and politeness . 
William Collins	agent	protested	He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .

William Collins	agent	met	Something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life . 
William Collins	agent	declared	When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ’s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ’s room . 
William Collins	agent	found	In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 
William Collins	agent	seemed	Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .

William Collins	agent	asked	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living .

You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . “ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ” said he , when she had finished her speech .

William Collins	agent	have	Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . ” 
William Collins	agent	made	I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage .

William Collins	agent	joined	She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls,-- “ Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together .

William Collins	agent	replied	“ My dear madam , ” replied he , “ let us be for ever silent on this point . 
William Collins	agent	continued	Far be it from me , ” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “ to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 
William Collins	agent	hope	You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .

William Collins	agent	entreated	In as short a time as Mr. Collins ’s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .

William Collins	agent	returned	She resolved to give her the information herself ; and therefore charged Mr. Collins , when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 
William Collins	agent	longing	the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . 
William Collins	agent	visit	As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs. Bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 
William Collins	agent	replied	“ My dear madam , ” he replied , “ this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ”

William Collins	agent	fancying	The possibility of Mr. Collins ’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two : but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself ; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out,-- “ Engaged to Mr. Collins ! 
William Collins	agent	wishing	“ I see what you are feeling , ” replied Charlotte ; “ you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .

William Collins	agent	instructing	Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner , might not wholly overpower them .

William Collins	agent	expected	Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh . 
William Collins	agent	pointed	From the entrance hall , of which Mr. Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting .

William Collins	agent	walk	Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . 
William Collins	agent	carried	Elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .

William Collins	patient	seated	He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .

William Collins	patient	brought	The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . 
William Collins	patient	recommended	A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . 
William Collins	patient	followed	Lydia ’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten : every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr. Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford . 
William Collins	patient	used	In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .

William Collins	patient	brought	Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr. Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant ’s commission in the ----shire . 
William Collins	patient	watching	She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows . 
William Collins	patient	received	He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . 
William Collins	patient	included	He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . 
William Collins	patient	conveyed	As no objection was made to the young people ’s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr. Collins ’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle ’s invitation , and was then in the house . 
William Collins	patient	supposed	When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ’s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ’s room . 
William Collins	patient	employed	In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . 
William Collins	patient	removed	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living .

William Collins	patient	introduced	I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ” 
William Collins	patient	misleads	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . 
William Collins	patient	asking	Elizabeth ’s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley ’s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance . 
William Collins	patient	have	She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed . 
William Collins	patient	introduce	My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ” “ You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ? ” “ Indeed I am . 
William Collins	patient	answered	He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . 
William Collins	patient	commended	Many stared -- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed , in a half - whisper to Lady 
William Collins	patient	entreat	In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 
William Collins	patient	introduce	In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room . 
William Collins	patient	recommend	He assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . There was no arguing upon such a project . 
William Collins	patient	hearing	And upon Elizabeth ’s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , “ Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . ” 
William Collins	patient	Believe	Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- “ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , 
William Collins	patient	run	But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . ” The idea of Mr. Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued,-- “ My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .

William Collins	patient	Allow	Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . 
William Collins	patient	assure	Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . 
William Collins	patient	satisfy	But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , 
William Collins	patient	flatter	flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 
William Collins	patient	sink	flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . 
William Collins	patient	assure	And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 
William Collins	patient	entitled	To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother ’s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . 
William Collins	patient	assure	On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . 
William Collins	patient	discouraged	I am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ” 
William Collins	patient	given	And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,-- “ When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ” 
William Collins	patient	convince	, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ” 
William Collins	patient	flatter	“ You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course . 
William Collins	patient	left	Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs. Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . 
William Collins	patient	given	Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 
William Collins	patient	encourage	This information , however , startled Mrs. Bennet : she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so . 
William Collins	patient	Pardon	“ Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , ” cried Mr. Collins ; “ but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 
William Collins	patient	accepting	If , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ” 
William Collins	patient	marry	I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . ” She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out , as she entered the library,-- “ Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . “ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ” said he , when she had finished her speech .

William Collins	patient	marrying	Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ” 
William Collins	patient	marry	Your mother will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . ” 
William Collins	patient	marrying	You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . ” 
William Collins	patient	refuse	He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 
William Collins	patient	have	Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . 
William Collins	patient	marked	Far be it from me , ” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “ to resent the behaviour of your daughter . 
William Collins	patient	resigned	Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all : the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been , in early preferment ; and , I trust , I am resigned . 
William Collins	patient	honoured	Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 
William Collins	patient	consider	You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . 
William Collins	patient	accepted	My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ’s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error . 
William Collins	patient	keeps	“ It keeps him in good humour , ” said she , “ and I am more obliged to you than I can express . ” 
William Collins	patient	favoured	The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .

William Collins	patient	charged	She resolved to give her the information herself ; and therefore charged Mr. Collins , when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . 
William Collins	patient	see	As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs. Bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . 
William Collins	patient	avail	“ My dear madam , ” he replied , “ this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ” 
William Collins	patient	obliged	“ My dear sir , ” replied Mr. Collins , “ I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her Ladyship ’s concurrence . 
William Collins	patient	marries	My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . 
William Collins	patient	called	After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday . 
William Collins	patient	alleviated	The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . 
William Collins	patient	refused	He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . 
William Collins	patient	accompanied	From his garden , Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows ; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband ’s help . 
William Collins	patient	satisfy	But her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ’s praise into his own hands .

William Collins	patient	devoted	While Sir William was with them , Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country : but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration ; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .

William Collins	patient	accompanied	His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage ; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have [ Illustration : “ The gentlemen accompanied him . ” [ _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ ] ] the earliest assurance of it ; and , after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . 
William Collins	patient	accompanied	There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord ---- ; and , to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr. Collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him . 
William Collins	patient	accepted	“ Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ” “ Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .

William Collins	patient	told	He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . 
George Wickham	agent	touched	Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return . 
George Wickham	agent	walked	Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips ’s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ’s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs. Philips ’s throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .

George Wickham	agent	walked	The gentlemen did approach : and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 
George Wickham	agent	seated	Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .

George Wickham	agent	began	Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter , especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . 
George Wickham	agent	added	“ It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , ” he added , “ which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire . 
George Wickham	agent	know	I know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .

George Wickham	agent	have	I _ must _ have employment and society . 
George Wickham	agent	do	I can not do justice to his kindness . 
George Wickham	agent	forfeited	A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . 
George Wickham	agent	accuse	Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it .

George Wickham	agent	replied	“ I will not trust myself on the subject , ” replied Wickham ; “ _ I _ can hardly be just to him . ” 
George Wickham	agent	said	But she contented herself with--“And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner . 
George Wickham	agent	replied	If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ” “ It _ is _ wonderful , ” replied Wickham ; “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 
George Wickham	agent	believe	How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good - humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? 
George Wickham	agent	believe	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .

George Wickham	agent	given	” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham ’s attentions . There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips ’s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .

George Wickham	agent	engaged	She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed . 
George Wickham	agent	imagine	But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted , for Mr. Darcy ’s pleasure , in the Bingleys ’ invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile,-- “ I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ”

George Wickham	agent	approached	This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth ; and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ’s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham . 
George Wickham	agent	deserved	Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 
George Wickham	agent	walked	She highly approved his forbearance ; and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her 
George Wickham	agent	taken	to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , 
George Wickham	agent	suffered	The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr. Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy 
George Wickham	agent	had	To Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . 
George Wickham	agent	belonged	About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged .

George Wickham	agent	forget	His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .

George Wickham	agent	found	He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father ’s intentions .

George Wickham	agent	related	The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . 
George Wickham	agent	said	What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory ; and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other , and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . 
George Wickham	agent	resigning	But when she read and re - read , with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ’s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .

George Wickham	agent	has	We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . 
George Wickham	agent	insinuating	We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . 
George Wickham	agent	spoke	“ I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 
George Wickham	agent	said	From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . 
George Wickham	agent	knew	Yet he knew to the contrary himself . 
George Wickham	agent	marry	He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . ” “ And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? 
George Wickham	agent	has	There was also a postscript to this effect:-- “ I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ’s intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . 
George Wickham	agent	had	It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 
George Wickham	agent	kept	It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 
George Wickham	agent	had	It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . 
George Wickham	agent	left	And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ’s relations ; for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount . 
George Wickham	agent	owed	He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . 
George Wickham	agent	’s	“ Wickham ’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . ” 
George Wickham	agent	has	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ” said Elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . 
George Wickham	agent	resolved	The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . “ It was greatly my wish that he should do so , ” he added , “ as soon as his marriage was fixed on .

George Wickham	agent	has	He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- ’s regiment , now quartered in the north . 
George Wickham	agent	promises	He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 
George Wickham	agent	hope	He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 
George Wickham	agent	consent	Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme ; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 
George Wickham	agent	left	Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . 
George Wickham	agent	chose	She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 
George Wickham	agent	did	He did everything best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country .

George Wickham	agent	acknowledged	His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance as far as it would go . 
George Wickham	agent	found	But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . 
George Wickham	agent	thought	Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design . 
George Wickham	agent	confessed	He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia ’s flight on her own folly alone .

George Wickham	agent	marry	Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . 
George Wickham	agent	found	But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . 
George Wickham	agent	cherished	But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .

George Wickham	agent	had	Lydia came to us , and Wickham had constant admission to the house . 
George Wickham	agent	overtaken	She was roused from her seat and her reflections , by someone ’s approach ; and , before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .

George Wickham	agent	thought	I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . ” 
George Wickham	agent	heard	“ I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . 
George Wickham	agent	saw	When I last saw her , she was not very promising . 
George Wickham	agent	hope	I hope she will turn out well . ” 
George Wickham	agent	mention	“ I do not recollect that we did . ” “ I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had . 
George Wickham	agent	considered	I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . 
George Wickham	agent	told	Yes , there was something in _ that _ ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . ” 
George Wickham	agent	told	You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . ”

George Wickham	agent	smirks	He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . 
George Wickham	agent	treated	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . 
George Wickham	agent	mentioned	I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 
George Wickham	patient	seeing	The gentlemen did approach : and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . 
George Wickham	patient	seated	Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . 
George Wickham	patient	improve	“ I know little of the game at present , ” said he , “ but I shall be glad to improve myself ; for in my situation of life---- ” 
George Wickham	patient	engrossing	At first there seemed danger of Lydia ’s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets 
George Wickham	patient	hear	, she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for anyone in particular . Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy . 
George Wickham	patient	driven	“ Oh no -- it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . 
George Wickham	patient	seeing	If _ he _ wishes to avoid seeing _ me _ he must go . 
George Wickham	patient	tempted	I know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . 
George Wickham	patient	intended	A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . 
George Wickham	patient	accuse	Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . 
George Wickham	patient	hates	But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . 
George Wickham	patient	trust	“ I will not trust myself on the subject , ” replied Wickham ; “ _ I _ can hardly be just to him . ” 
George Wickham	patient	convinced	Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself . 
George Wickham	patient	astonished	After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying,-- “ I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley . 
George Wickham	patient	recommended	” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham ’s attentions . There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips ’s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully . 
George Wickham	patient	meeting	The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . 
George Wickham	patient	omitted	But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted , for Mr. Darcy ’s pleasure , in the Bingleys ’ invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile,-- “ I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ”

George Wickham	patient	liked	She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . 
George Wickham	patient	blessed	At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said,-- “ Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _ making _ friends ; whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . ”

George Wickham	patient	know	“ Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . ” “ No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . ” 
George Wickham	patient	saw	“ Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . ” “ No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . ” 
George Wickham	patient	inquire	After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton , to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . 
George Wickham	patient	Let	Let Wickham be your man . 
George Wickham	patient	saw	They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . 
George Wickham	patient	delighting	, she was delighting both him and herself . 
George Wickham	patient	inviting	At least you should not _ remind _ your mother of inviting him . ” 
George Wickham	patient	justify	“ _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ . 
George Wickham	patient	brought	She was not rendered formidable by silence : but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to 
George Wickham	patient	mentioned	But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited 
George Wickham	patient	injured	, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . 
George Wickham	patient	supported	Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’s education . 
George Wickham	patient	invite	I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . 
George Wickham	patient	present	He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father ’s intentions .

George Wickham	patient	obtruded	But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . 
George Wickham	patient	went	About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained

George Wickham	patient	revenging	Mr. Wickham ’s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . 
George Wickham	patient	meeting	She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . 
George Wickham	patient	established	His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . 
George Wickham	patient	rescue	She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years ’ continuance . 
George Wickham	patient	see	She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address , but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .

George Wickham	patient	concerned	How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned ! 
George Wickham	patient	betrayed	together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible . She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .

George Wickham	patient	seeing	She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . 
George Wickham	patient	exposing	Miss Bennet paused a little , and then replied , “ Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . 
George Wickham	patient	place	The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 
George Wickham	patient	gone	Wickham will soon be gone ; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . 
George Wickham	patient	see	Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time . 
George Wickham	patient	asked	She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal . On the very last day of the regiment ’s remaining in Meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s and Mr. Darcy ’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .

George Wickham	patient	liked	He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but , with a moment ’s recollection , and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him . 
George Wickham	patient	saw	With an air of indifference , he soon afterwards added , “ How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? ” “ Nearly three weeks . ” “ And you saw him frequently ? ” “ Yes , almost every day . ” “ His manners are very different from his cousin ’s . ” 
George Wickham	patient	checking	“ And pray may I ask-- ” but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , “ Is it in address that he improves ? 
George Wickham	patient	improved	for I dare not hope , ” he continued , in a lower and more serious tone , “ that he is improved in essentials . ” 
George Wickham	patient	knowing	There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added,-- “ When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . 
George Wickham	patient	shaking	” Wickham ’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents,-- “ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . 
George Wickham	patient	deter	His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . 
George Wickham	patient	left	My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . 
George Wickham	patient	know	_ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . 
George Wickham	patient	tempt	She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . ” 
George Wickham	patient	attached	While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise , all astonishment , that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible . 
George Wickham	patient	thought	“ Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , ” said her sister . 
George Wickham	patient	see	How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! 
George Wickham	patient	assist	We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . ” 
George Wickham	patient	prevailed	He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement . 
George Wickham	patient	assist	It is Mr. Wickham ’s intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . 
George Wickham	patient	gave	Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness . 
George Wickham	patient	provoke	The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . 
George Wickham	patient	married	I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . 
George Wickham	patient	saw	He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . 
George Wickham	patient	confessed	He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia ’s flight on her own folly alone . 
George Wickham	patient	knew	_ He _ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she stayed with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ’s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain .

Charles Bingley	agent	joined	On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 
Charles Bingley	agent	excuse	I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .

Charles Bingley	agent	talked	Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . 
Charles Bingley	agent	make	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 
Charles Bingley	agent	engaged	Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 
Charles Bingley	agent	eclipsed	Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield . [ Illustration : “ to assure you in the most animated language ” ] CHAPTER XIX . The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 
Charles Bingley	agent	coming	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that 
Charles Bingley	agent	marry	They may wish many things besides his happiness : they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	choose	“ Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy , ” replied Jane ; “ but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . 
Charles Bingley	agent	attached	If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us 
Charles Bingley	agent	returning	Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more ; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . 
Charles Bingley	agent	saw	Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 
Charles Bingley	agent	growing	“ I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . 
Charles Bingley	agent	felt	Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? ” “ Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . 
Charles Bingley	agent	has	She found that she was to receive no other answer ; and , after a short pause , added,-- “ I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	wants	Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care .

Charles Bingley	agent	indebted	From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . 
Charles Bingley	agent	told	What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .

Charles Bingley	agent	spoke	He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .

Charles Bingley	agent	deceived	To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . 
Charles Bingley	agent	see	That they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .

Charles Bingley	agent	entered	They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ’s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . 
Charles Bingley	agent	expressed	All Elizabeth ’s anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . 
Charles Bingley	agent	inquired	He inquired in a friendly , though general , way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done .

He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it “ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ” and , before she could reply , he added , “ It is above eight months . 
Charles Bingley	agent	said	It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself ; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from _ hauteur _ or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . 
Charles Bingley	agent	seeking	When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .

Charles Bingley	agent	expressed	Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . 
Charles Bingley	agent	coming	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ” ( for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news ) . 
Charles Bingley	agent	likes	But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 
Charles Bingley	agent	coming	And so , it is quite certain he is coming ? ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	comes	“ As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ you will wait on him , of course . ”

Charles Bingley	agent	arrived	Mr. Bingley arrived . 
Charles Bingley	agent	enter	But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . 
Charles Bingley	agent	went	She inquired after his sister , but could do no more . “ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ” said Mrs. Bennet . 
Charles Bingley	agent	come	He readily agreed to it . “ I began to be afraid you would never come back again . 
Charles Bingley	agent	meant	People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . 
Charles Bingley	agent	went	A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . 
Charles Bingley	agent	heard	I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . 
Charles Bingley	agent	replied	Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .

Charles Bingley	agent	meant	It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 
Charles Bingley	agent	believed	A few weeks , he believed . 
Charles Bingley	agent	killed	“ When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , ” said her mother , “ I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet ’s manor .

Charles Bingley	agent	take	When they repaired to the dining - room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . 
Charles Bingley	agent	seemed	On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .

Charles Bingley	agent	had	I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	called	Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _ me _ your confidante . ” CHAPTER LV . A few days after this visit , Mr. Bingley called again , and alone . 
Charles Bingley	agent	sat	He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . 
Charles Bingley	agent	confessed	Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .

Charles Bingley	agent	call	“ Next time you call , ” said she , “ I hope we shall be more lucky . ” He should be particularly happy at any time , etc . , etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 
Charles Bingley	agent	come	“ Can you come to - morrow ? 
Charles Bingley	agent	had	Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 
Charles Bingley	agent	accepted	Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . 
Charles Bingley	agent	came	He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . 
Charles Bingley	agent	bore	Bingley was everything that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .

His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter . 
Charles Bingley	agent	needed	He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet ’s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .

Charles Bingley	agent	spent	Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 
Charles Bingley	agent	returned	Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet ’s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter . 
Charles Bingley	agent	standing	On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all .

Charles Bingley	agent	rose	Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and , whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 
Charles Bingley	agent	ran	Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and , whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . 
Charles Bingley	agent	opened	“ Where is your sister ? ” said he hastily , as he opened the door . 
Charles Bingley	agent	say	She will be down in a moment , I dare say . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	shut	He then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 
Charles Bingley	agent	claimed	He then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . 
Charles Bingley	agent	had	They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of Jane ’s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 
Charles Bingley	agent	thought	Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 
Charles Bingley	agent	made	“ He has made me so happy , ” said she , one evening , “ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! 
Charles Bingley	agent	account	“ But how did he account for it ? ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	utter	“ That is the most unforgiving speech , ” said Elizabeth , “ that I ever heard you utter . 
Charles Bingley	agent	believe	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ” “ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	do	as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ’s visit . 
Charles Bingley	agent	proposed	The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out . 
Charles Bingley	agent	allowed	Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . 
Charles Bingley	agent	depending	His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy . 
Charles Bingley	agent	remained	But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ’s sentiments . 
Charles Bingley	agent	forgiven	He has heartily forgiven me now . 
Charles Bingley	agent	had	Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . 
Charles Bingley	agent	looked	Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , “ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”

Charles Bingley	agent	replied	It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ” “ It may do very well for the others , ” replied Mr. Bingley ; “ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 
Charles Bingley	agent	remained	Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . 
Charles Bingley	agent	proceeded	Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even Bingley ’s good - humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone . 
Charles Bingley	agent	authorized	Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl ; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 
Charles Bingley	agent	chose	Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl ; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose . 
Charles Bingley	agent	admire	It was generally evident , whenever they met , that he _ did _ admire her ; and to _ her _ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . 
Charles Bingley	agent	know	“ Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ’s disposition as you do . ” “ But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . ”

Charles Bingley	agent	sees	“ Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . 
Charles Bingley	agent	had	Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and 
Charles Bingley	agent	mean	My dear Charles , what do you mean ? ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	comprehend	“ Then , ” observed Elizabeth , “ you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	knowing	“ I am no longer surprised at your knowing _ only _ six accomplished women . 
Charles Bingley	agent	knowing	I rather wonder now at your knowing _ any _ . ” “ Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ” “ _ I _ never saw such a woman . 
Charles Bingley	agent	describe	_ I _ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	writes	“ Oh , ” cried Miss Bingley , “ Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . 
Charles Bingley	agent	leaves	He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	blots	He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	determine	I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ” 
Charles Bingley	agent	gets	“ ‘ When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . 
Charles Bingley	agent	comes	“ It is evident by this , ” added Jane , “ that he comes back no more this winter . ” “ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . ” “ Why will you think so ? 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	“ But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ” “ It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ” “ But consider your daughters . 
Charles Bingley	patient	visit	Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	assure	I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though 
Charles Bingley	patient	visit	He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it . 
Charles Bingley	patient	meet	“ But you forget , mamma , ” said Elizabeth , “ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . ” “ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . 
Charles Bingley	patient	introduce	“ But you forget , mamma , ” said Elizabeth , “ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . ” “ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . 
Charles Bingley	patient	introduce	“ Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . ” “ Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ” “ I honour your circumspection . 
Charles Bingley	patient	attacked	They attacked him in various ways , with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour , Lady Lucas . 
Charles Bingley	patient	looked	The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and

Charles Bingley	patient	press	Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it . 
Charles Bingley	patient	met	Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	fancying	He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! 
Charles Bingley	patient	admired	When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 
Charles Bingley	patient	like	Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 
Charles Bingley	patient	provided	Mr. Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but , as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase 
Charles Bingley	patient	established	His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table ; nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 
Charles Bingley	patient	tempted	Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted , by an accidental recommendation , to look at Netherfield House . 
Charles Bingley	patient	endeared	Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . 
Charles Bingley	patient	asking	Mr. Robinson ’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ‘ Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ’ ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	enable	Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance . 
Charles Bingley	patient	keep	Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance . 
Charles Bingley	patient	assure	But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you . 
Charles Bingley	patient	troubling	She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy . 
Charles Bingley	patient	tax	The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit ; and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . 
Charles Bingley	patient	address	She was very equal , therefore , to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 
Charles Bingley	patient	reminded	She was very equal , therefore , to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .

Charles Bingley	patient	defer	If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . ” “ What you ask , ” said Elizabeth , “ is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . 
Charles Bingley	patient	know	Do you know Mr. Bingley ? ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	imposed	“ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . 
Charles Bingley	patient	imposed	“ I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . ” But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . 
Charles Bingley	patient	assure	It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	complimenting	They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation , and , by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins , who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .

Charles Bingley	patient	assure	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 
Charles Bingley	patient	obliged	Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 
Charles Bingley	patient	detained	Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	invited	After lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again , and soon dining at Longbourn ; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses . CHAPTER XXII . 
Charles Bingley	patient	gone	Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 
Charles Bingley	patient	seeing	After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . Mr. Collins ’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet . 
Charles Bingley	patient	keeping	would be successful in keeping him away 
Charles Bingley	patient	influence	“ You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? ” “ Yes , in conjunction with his friend . ” “ I can not believe it . 
Charles Bingley	patient	influence	Why should they try to influence him ? 
Charles Bingley	patient	attached	They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . 
Charles Bingley	patient	got	“ I do not blame Jane , ” she continued , “ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . 
Charles Bingley	patient	describe	A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	seeing	Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ’s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped , by Caroline ’s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . 
Charles Bingley	patient	congratulated	What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . 
Charles Bingley	patient	separate	That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . 
Charles Bingley	patient	retaining	When she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ’s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister . 
Charles Bingley	patient	detached	The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham . 
Charles Bingley	patient	seen	I had often seen him in love before . 
Charles Bingley	patient	convince	To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . 
Charles Bingley	patient	deceived	To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . 
Charles Bingley	patient	persuade	To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . 
Charles Bingley	patient	restoring	Anxiety on Jane ’s behalf was another prevailing concern ; and Mr. Darcy ’s explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 
Charles Bingley	patient	prefer	Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . “ Well , Lizzy , ” said Mrs. Bennet , one day , “ what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane ’s ? 
Charles Bingley	patient	expressed	All Elizabeth ’s anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	They had long wished to see him . 
Charles Bingley	patient	seeing	Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 
Charles Bingley	patient	visiting	You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . 
Charles Bingley	patient	asking	But , however , that sha n’t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ’s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley , in consequence of it , before _ they _ did . 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	“ It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . 
Charles Bingley	patient	comfort	“ I wish I could say anything to comfort you , ” replied Elizabeth ; “ but it is wholly out of my power . 
Charles Bingley	patient	seeing	She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent -- hopeless of seeing him before . 
Charles Bingley	patient	asked	It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . 
Charles Bingley	patient	oblige	I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	assure	I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . 
Charles Bingley	patient	keep	I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . 
Charles Bingley	patient	invite	Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . 
Charles Bingley	patient	placed	He placed himself by her . 
Charles Bingley	patient	get	Mrs. Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits : she had seen enough of Bingley ’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .

Charles Bingley	patient	blessed	I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	left	His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days ’ time . 
Charles Bingley	patient	invited	Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . 
Charles Bingley	patient	come	He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come . 
Charles Bingley	patient	disgust	There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him .

Charles Bingley	patient	gone	In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief . 
Charles Bingley	patient	see	It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ’s pretended regard . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	offended	I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . 
Charles Bingley	patient	do	“ What do you mean ? ” “ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . 
Charles Bingley	patient	mention	She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia ’s marriage . 
Charles Bingley	patient	fixing	If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . 
Charles Bingley	patient	help	Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . 
Charles Bingley	patient	help	” “ But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . 
Charles Bingley	patient	command	Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . 
Charles Bingley	patient	known	She has known him only a fortnight . 
Charles Bingley	patient	saw	She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . 
Charles Bingley	patient	took	They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet ’s civilities . 
Charles Bingley	patient	follow	She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street , where Mr. Hurst had a house . 
Charles Bingley	patient	opposed	But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ’s . 
Charles Bingley	patient	saw	He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . 
Charles Bingley	patient	detaching	His sisters ’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own : our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . 
Charles Bingley	patient	advise	I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ” 
Charles Bingley	patient	following	“ ‘ When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .

Charles Bingley	patient	call	My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’s heart . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	believe	“ But you forget , mamma , ” said Elizabeth , “ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . ” “ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	have	She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	deigned	Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	honour	“ Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . ” “ Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ” “ I honour your circumspection . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	said	Mrs. Bennet said only , “ Nonsense , nonsense ! ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	surpassing	The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished -- that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	knew	But I knew I should persuade you at last . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	see	“ If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , ” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband , “ and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . ”

Mrs. Bennet	agent	planned	An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched ; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	imagine	She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	say	I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst ’s gown----

Mrs. Bennet	agent	said	Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . “ I am astonished , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	wished	If I wished to think slightingly of anybody ’s children , it should not be of my own , however . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	say	When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	remember	I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ’s in his regimentals . ”

Mrs. Bennet	agent	departed	Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley ’s witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	continued	They had often attempted it before : but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	think	“ It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ” “ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	remain	I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , “ WILLIAM COLLINS . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	seeing	He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	answered	This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- “ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	set	But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him , with some asperity , that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	spoken	She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	condescended	She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	said	“ That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	cried	“ Ah , ” cried Mrs. Bennet , shaking her head , “ then she is better off than many girls .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	walked	Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , Mr. Collins began,-- “ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	believe	This information , however , startled Mrs. Bennet : she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	speak	I will speak to her about it myself directly .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	go	I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . ” She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out , as she entered the library,-- “ Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . “ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ” said he , when she had finished her speech .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	wished	Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs. Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	marrying	You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	give	Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs. Bennet give up the point . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	talked	She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	endeavoured	She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane , with all possible mildness , declined interfering ; and

Mrs. Bennet	agent	added	“ Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , ” she added , in a melancholy tone ; “ for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me ; I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	continued	“ Ay , there she comes , ” continued Mrs. Bennet , “ looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	tell	But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	have	I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	have	Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	do	People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	suffer	Nobody can tell what I suffer ! 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	began	In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation:-- “ Oh , Mr. Collins ! ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	hear	They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ’s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	wished	Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	rated	She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others : there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her ; and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that , if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	hated	She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	failed	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	spoke	[ Illustration : “ _ Whenever she spoke in a low voice _ ” ] Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	leaving	A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last , on Mrs. Bennet ’s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying,-- “ O that my dear mother had more command over herself ! 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	continued	Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more ; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	had	On the following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	had	Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	saw	They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	blame	“ I do not blame Jane , ” she continued , “ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	continued	“ I do not blame Jane , ” she continued , “ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	have	The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	provided	Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	wished	His marriage was now fast approaching ; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say , in an ill - natured tone , that she “ _ wished _ they might be happy . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	rejoiced	Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,---- “ I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	said	Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . “ Well , Lizzy , ” said Mrs. Bennet , one day , “ what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane ’s ? 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	told	I told my sister Philips so the other day . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	suppose	Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	inquired	There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	put	Nobody wants him to come ; though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and , if I was her , I would not have put up with it . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	observed	“ If one could but go to Brighton ! ” observed Mrs. Bennet . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	miss	Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and , in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	received	Mrs. Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ’ conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill - usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill - judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	said	“ If I had been able , ” said she , “ to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	thought	I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	ruled	I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	killed	And now here ’s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	know	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	replied	As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ” “ Oh , my dear brother , ” replied Mrs. Bennet , “ that is exactly what I could most wish for . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	frightened	Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	know	I know you will contrive it all . ” But Mr. Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	cried	“ What ! is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? ” she cried . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	contain	Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	had	Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy ; and 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	took	But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such a husband her misery was considered certain . It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	searching	She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter ; and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . “ Haye Park might do , ” said she , “ if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	comprehend	Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	believe	That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . 
Mrs. Bennet	agent	eloping	She was more alive to the disgrace , which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ’s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place .

Mrs. Bennet	agent	seen	Mrs. Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits : she had seen enough of Bingley ’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .

Mrs. Bennet	patient	sharpened	Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	interrupted	Here she was interrupted again . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	obliged	She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit , and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	told	Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	prevented	Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	attended	After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ’s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	told	When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself ; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	bring	But Mrs. Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ’s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .

Mrs. Bennet	patient	complimented	He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	touched	The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet ’s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	displeased	He begged pardon for having displeased her . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	presented	“ Has she been presented ? 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	gratified	Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips ’s manners and politeness . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	avoiding	To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	addressed	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	finding	On finding Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words,-- “ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ” 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	startled	This information , however , startled Mrs. Bennet : she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	interrupting	“ Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , ” cried Mr. Collins ; “ but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	misunderstand	“ Sir , you quite misunderstand me , ” said Mrs. Bennet , alarmed . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	understanding	I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . ” She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out , as she entered the library,-- “ Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . “ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ” said he , when she had finished her speech . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	persuaded	Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs. Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	promised	You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	used	“ Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , ” she added , in a melancholy tone ; “ for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me ; I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	Believe	“ Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	struck	She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others : there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her ; and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that , if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	overpowered	Mrs. Bennet was , in fact , too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	incensed	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	receiving	On the following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the Christmas at Longbourn . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	enjoying	Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and , in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	restored	Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	ruled	I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	seen	And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	told	When Mrs. Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	contain	Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself . 
Mrs. Bennet	patient	disappointed	I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	cough	“ Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ” said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . “ What an excellent father you have , girls , ” said she , when the door was shut . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	choose	“ Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ” said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . “ What an excellent father you have , girls , ” said she , when the door was shut .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	had	Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	says	Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	stared	Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	exclaimed	Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	continued	She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	given	There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ” Mr. Wickham ’s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh . “ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	unite	“ Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	looking	To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further . CHAPTER XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	drew	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	reproached	Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	added	“ A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . ” “ And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , ” added Kitty . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	continued	Wholly inattentive to her sister ’s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone ’s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . “ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ” said she , “ though I am _ not _ her particular friend .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	joined	In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	says	They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	added	It will pass away soon enough . ” “ Do you suppose them to be in London ? ” “ Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? ” “ And Lydia used to want to go to London , ” added Kitty .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	said	Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister . “ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ” said Kitty ; “ who can it be ? ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	agent	replied	“ La ! ” replied Kitty , “ it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	patient	seeing	Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . “ Indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	patient	obliging	“ Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ” Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment ’s deliberation,-- “ I am not . ”

Lady Catherine de Bourgh	patient	please	I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	patient	thanking	Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologizing if he thought he won too many .

Lydia Bennet	agent	anticipated	The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham 
Lydia Bennet	agent	applied	But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted , for Mr. Darcy ’s pleasure , in the Bingleys ’ invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile,-- “ I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ” 
Lydia Bennet	agent	unheard	This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth ; and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ’s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	cried	She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , “ I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! 
Lydia Bennet	agent	stood	Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and 
Lydia Bennet	agent	take	Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	looking	To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further . CHAPTER XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	added	“ And we mean to treat you all , ” added Lydia ; “ but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . ” 
Lydia Bennet	agent	lend	“ And we mean to treat you all , ” added Lydia ; “ but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . ” 
Lydia Bennet	agent	bought	Then showing her purchases,--“Look here , I have bought this bonnet . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	think	I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	thought	I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not .

Lydia Bennet	agent	make	I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . ” 
Lydia Bennet	agent	added	And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , “ Oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .

Lydia Bennet	agent	say	It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	got	“ Now I have got some news for you , ” said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	said	“ Now I have got some news for you , ” said Lydia , as they sat down to table . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	laughed	Lydia laughed , and said,-- “ Ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	dare	I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	going	I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	saw	I never saw such a long chin in my life . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	answer	I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	cried	“ How nicely we are crammed in ! ” cried Lydia . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	brought	“ I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box ! 
Lydia Bennet	agent	declare	Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	think	She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	like	how I should like to be married before any of you ! 
Lydia Bennet	agent	laughed	how I laughed ! 
Lydia Bennet	agent	thought	I thought I should have died . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	died	I thought I should have died . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	said	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .

Lydia Bennet	agent	attended	She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	given	She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .

Lydia Bennet	agent	said	“ I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , ” said Lydia . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	flew	Wholly inattentive to her sister ’s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone ’s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . “ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ” said she , “ though I am _ not _ her particular friend .

Lydia Bennet	agent	exposed	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ” 
Lydia Bennet	agent	do	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ”

Lydia Bennet	agent	leads	She will follow wherever Lydia leads . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	go	We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	go	Let her go , then . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	grow	At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	known	Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	saw	She saw , with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing - place covered with officers . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	saw	She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	saw	She saw all the glories of the camp : its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .

Lydia Bennet	agent	known	Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? 
Lydia Bennet	agent	going	Lydia ’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ’s never intending to go there himself . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	returned	The rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance _ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	went	” When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .

Lydia Bennet	agent	lost	Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ’s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! 
Lydia Bennet	agent	swallowed	Lydia -- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all -- soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said,-- “ I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern .

Lydia Bennet	agent	attached	While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise , all astonishment , that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	engaging	For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	had	She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody .

Lydia Bennet	agent	used	It will pass away soon enough . ” “ Do you suppose them to be in London ? ” “ Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? ” “ And Lydia used to want to go to London , ” added Kitty . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	interrupted	They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ’s tea . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	got	Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ”

Lydia Bennet	agent	come	To be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world in some distant farm - house . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	expected	Lydia ’s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites .

Lydia Bennet	agent	led	Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .

Lydia Bennet	agent	dropped	She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropped , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	seems	“ You may readily comprehend , ” she added , “ what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ” 
Lydia Bennet	agent	let	Jane ’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .

Lydia Bennet	agent	run	The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world ; though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	left	My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . 
Lydia Bennet	agent	has	She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . ” 
Lydia Bennet	agent	like	I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	flatter	“ This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	brought	Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	recommended	She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ’s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	told	My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	bid	Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr. Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said,-- “ I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	fatigued	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	amuse	” With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ’s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	hear	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	recommended	A resemblance in good - humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their _ three _ months ’ acquaintance they had been intimate _ two _ . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	exposed	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ” 
Lydia Bennet	patient	teaching	If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	keep	Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	lock	At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	tear	Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? 
Lydia Bennet	patient	consoled	Lydia ’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ’s never intending to go there himself . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	called	Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs. Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt , for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	gone	An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! 
Lydia Bennet	patient	marry	short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. , intending to trace their route . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	attach	She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	concerned	Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	given	But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	allowed	She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	recovering	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	tell	And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	involves	But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ” Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , “ Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ” Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .

Lydia Bennet	patient	persuade	But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	marry	Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? ” As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	interrupting	Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ” 
Lydia Bennet	patient	marry	“ I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . ” 
Lydia Bennet	patient	marry	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	married	As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner ’s hope of Lydia ’s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	see	I shall see her again ! 
Lydia Bennet	patient	married	She will be married at sixteen ! 
Lydia Bennet	patient	see	How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! 
Lydia Bennet	patient	give	Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	seeking	When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	marrying	But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such a husband her misery was considered certain . It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . 
Lydia Bennet	patient	settled	Lydia ’s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites .

Lydia Bennet	patient	married	Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- “ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ?

Mr. Bennet	agent	said	“ No more have I , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ” 
Mr. Bennet	agent	decline	But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . ”

But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ” “ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .

Caroline Bingley	agent	saw	Miss Bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .

Caroline Bingley	agent	had	They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley ’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	removed	The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed , at his desire , to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be farther from the door .

Caroline Bingley	agent	mean	“ If you mean Darcy , ” cried her brother , “ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . ”

Caroline Bingley	agent	recommend	Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	know	I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .

Caroline Bingley	agent	learnt	Elizabeth instantly read her feelings ; and , at that moment , solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of Jane ’s being in the fairest way for happiness . “ I want to know , ” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ’s , “ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	looks	But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? 
Caroline Bingley	agent	mean	“ It is evident by this , ” added Jane , “ that he comes back no more this winter . ” “ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . ” “ Why will you think so ?

Caroline Bingley	agent	have	But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	return	She represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . Jane ’s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart .

Caroline Bingley	agent	said	Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	watched	Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	saw	Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility,-- “ Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ?

Caroline Bingley	agent	known	Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ’s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	approach	Elizabeth ’s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 
Caroline Bingley	agent	venting	Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth ’s person , behaviour , and dress .

Caroline Bingley	agent	prevailed	As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .

Caroline Bingley	agent	doubted	That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .

Caroline Bingley	patient	mortified	Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ’s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropped all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility 
Caroline Bingley	patient	convinced	Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . 
Caroline Bingley	patient	deceived	Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ” “ That is right . 
Caroline Bingley	patient	deceived	You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means . 
Caroline Bingley	patient	disposed	That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . 
Caroline Bingley	patient	gives	she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . 
Caroline Bingley	patient	reached	I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .

Charlotte Lucas	agent	replied	“ It may , perhaps , be pleasant , ” replied Charlotte , “ to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . 
Charlotte Lucas	agent	said	“ Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ” “ Well , ” said Charlotte , “ I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .

Charlotte Lucas	agent	assured	Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . 
Charlotte Lucas	agent	dying	The younger girls formed hopes of _ coming out _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ’s dying an old maid .

Charlotte Lucas	agent	came	Whenever Charlotte came to see them 
Charlotte Lucas	agent	anticipating	, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead . 
Charlotte Lucas	agent	take	“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ” said she , “ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ” “ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .

Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .

Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .

Charlotte Lucas	patient	succeeded	After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	entreating	] Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs. Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family . 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	awaited	But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	entreated	In as short a time as Mr. Collins ’s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	telling	The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied,-- “ Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	envying	Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton . 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	accompanied	Thursday was to be the wedding - day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	tell	Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ? 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	met	Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs. Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . 
Charlotte Lucas	patient	gone	Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .

Mrs. Gardiner	agent	spoke	When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . 
Mrs. Gardiner	agent	suppose	Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? ” “ Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .

Mrs. Gardiner	agent	hope	I hope they will not meet at all . 
Mrs. Gardiner	agent	observed	on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth ’s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . 
Mrs. Gardiner	agent	saw	Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .

Mrs. Gardiner	agent	tried	On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy ’s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ’s reputed disposition , when quite a lad , which might agree with it ; and was confident , at last , that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .

Mrs. Gardiner	agent	thought	Mrs. Gardiner ’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone : after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on:-- “ You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .

Mrs. Gardiner	agent	see	I see the imprudence of it . 
Mrs. Gardiner	agent	promise	In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see , every day , that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld , by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures , if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist ? 
Mrs. Gardiner	agent	promise	All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .

Mrs. Gardiner	agent	thought	They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ’s beginning the subject . 
Mrs. Gardiner	agent	cried	“ But what is to be done about Pemberley ? ” cried Mrs. Gardiner .

Mrs. Gardiner	agent	went	Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .

Mrs. Gardiner	patient	show	But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner ’s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . 
Mrs. Gardiner	patient	answered	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write .

Sir William Lucas	agent	tell	Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? 
Sir William Lucas	agent	know	Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? ” 
Sir William Lucas	agent	begged	Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment : but Sir William ’s good - breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .

Sir William Lucas	agent	accompanied	From his garden , Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows ; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband ’s help .

Sir William Lucas	agent	had	In spite of having been at St. James ’s , Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .

Sir William Lucas	patient	occupy	It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and , quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge ; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 
Sir William Lucas	patient	compliment	At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but , on perceiving Mr. Darcy , he stopped , with a bow of superior courtesy , to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . “ I have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir ; such very superior dancing is not often seen .

Georgiana Darcy	agent	said	I scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . ” “ Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , ” said Darcy , “ has too much truth . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	comprehend	“ Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	added	A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and , besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . ” “ All this she must possess , ” added Darcy ; “ and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . ”

Georgiana Darcy	agent	replied	“ Undoubtedly , ” replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , “ there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	said	“ The country , ” said Darcy , “ can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	has	Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ” As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	take	Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	wish	“ It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ’s family it would be an unpleasant thing . ” “ You may depend upon my not mentioning it . ” “ And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .

Georgiana Darcy	agent	reached	It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ’s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley -- for she had reached it only to a late breakfast -- ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning . They were , therefore , to go .

Georgiana Darcy	agent	looked	Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	expressed	The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother ’s in sending it .

Georgiana Darcy	agent	went	When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	recovered	Elizabeth ’s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	join	But Georgiana would not join her . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	returned	When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .

Georgiana Darcy	agent	saw	He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	began	By Elizabeth ’s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . 
Georgiana Darcy	agent	loved	Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	grown	“ Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? ” said Miss Bingley : “ will she be as tall as I am ? ” “ I think she will .

Georgiana Darcy	patient	superintends	She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father ’s death her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	marry	Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	get	But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	admires	But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	choose	“ Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy , ” replied Jane ; “ but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .

Georgiana Darcy	patient	acquainted	This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	admires	My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’s heart .

Georgiana Darcy	patient	stating	She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	pitied	Georgiana ’s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	leave	Her brother ’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour : his judgment could not err ; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	following	He then told her of Georgiana ’s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . 
Georgiana Darcy	patient	delighted	Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	encouraged	Mr. Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks : Mrs. Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . “ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ”

Mr. Gardiner	agent	advanced	their progress was slow , for Mr. Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	left	Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	remained	An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr. Gardiner , meanwhile , having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	replied	“ In the first place , ” replied Mr. Gardiner , “ there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	told	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	assured	I know you will contrive it all . ” But Mr. Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	waited	Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	left	Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him : it told them , that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street . That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	meant	Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure ; but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	added	He added , that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London , and promised to write again very soon . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	written	There was also a postscript to this effect:-- “ I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ’s intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	found	“ Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	marry	Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? ” As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	comes	Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? ” As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	done	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ” said Elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	pledged	We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	had	If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	wrote	Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	replied	To Mr. Bennet ’s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	concluded	To Mr. Bennet ’s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	added	The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . “ It was greatly my wish that he should do so , ” he added , “ as soon as his marriage was fixed on . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	think	And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ’s . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	hope	He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	subjoin	And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	understand	They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	do	Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ’s removal from the ----shire , as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	keeps	He keeps a man - servant , does he ? 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	does	He keeps a man - servant , does he ? 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	laid	But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	act	Your uncle is as much surprised as I am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	done	Your uncle is as much surprised as I am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	had	On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	came	He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both -- Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	left	From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	came	From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	called	He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	had	If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	had	He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	resolving	He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	say	There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	knew	This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	got	This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	get	But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	acquainted	Everything being settled between _ them _ , Mr. Darcy ’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	done	The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	returned	When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	storm	I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	asked	At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs. Reynolds replied , that he was ; adding , “ But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	stopped	As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also ; and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	said	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ” said her uncle . “ There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ” replied her aunt ; “ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	replied	“ But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , ” replied her uncle . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	take	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	warn	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	set	They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	entered	She was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ’s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	thinking	“ I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , ” said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; “ and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .

Mr. Gardiner	agent	think	“ Do you really think so ? ” cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	believe	But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	know	As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	does	and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	mean	my uncle ! ” cried Jane , “ what do you mean , sir ? ” 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	consenting	His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	came	luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ’ time , and then we all set out . 
Mr. Gardiner	agent	set	luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ’ time , and then we all set out . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	reached	Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner ’s house , where they were to remain a few days . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	prevented	Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	declared	Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	find	Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia ’s situation , hastily exclaimed , “ I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . ” “ Good God ! 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	thanked	Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , everything relating to their journey was speedily settled . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	pledged	We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	pledged	I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	tell	He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both -- Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	disgrace	If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	forced	But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .

Mr. Gardiner	patient	paid	Had it been your uncle ’s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	pay	I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	accompany	Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	expect	At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs. Reynolds replied , that he was ; adding , “ But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	warn	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ” 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	persuaded	She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	hire	and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	welcomed	Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	lost	But , no , ” recollecting herself , “ that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	come	His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . 
Mr. Gardiner	patient	prevented	However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . ” 
Mary Bennet	agent	consider	you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? 
Mary Bennet	agent	say	What say you , Mary ? 
Mary Bennet	agent	wished	Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . “ While Mary is adjusting her ideas , ” he continued , “ let us return to Mr. Bingley . ”

Mary Bennet	agent	understand	did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . 
Mary Bennet	agent	singing	She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . 
Mary Bennet	agent	finished	He took the hint , and , when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud,-- “ That will do extremely well , child . 
Mary Bennet	agent	liked	“ She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . ” 
Mary Bennet	agent	gone	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .

Mary Bennet	agent	replied	To this , Mary very gravely replied , “ Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . 
Mary Bennet	agent	confess	But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ . 
Mary Bennet	agent	prefer	I should infinitely prefer a book . ” 
Mary Bennet	agent	thank	Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . 
Mary Bennet	agent	joined	In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before . 
Mary Bennet	agent	incurred	The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty . 
Mary Bennet	agent	continued	Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . 
Mary Bennet	agent	studies	Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . 
Mary Bennet	agent	went	After tea , Mr. Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went upstairs to her instrument .

Mary Bennet	patient	piqued	“ Pride , ” observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , “ is a very common failing , I believe . 
Mary Bennet	patient	convinced	By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . 
Mary Bennet	patient	given	After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 
Mary Bennet	patient	found	They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to . 
Mary Bennet	patient	prevailed	Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . 
Mary Bennet	patient	marrying	There is no danger of Wickham ’s marrying Mary King -- there ’s for you !

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	add	Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings . It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen ’s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	called	Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr. Darcy they had 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	seemed	Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them : anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs. Collins ’s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	seated	He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	saying	_ His _ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her Ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out,-- “ What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	came	It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration , of her former favourite , George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s manners , she 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	have	believed he might have the best informed mind . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	laughing	Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend Eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out : she watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success .

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	thought	It seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance ; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	asking	He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins ’s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _ there _ too .

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	meant	She supposed , if he meant anything , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	meeting	She was engaged one day , as she walked , in re - perusing Jane ’s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy , she saw , on looking up , that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	walked	Putting away the letter immediately , and forcing a smile , she said,-- “ I did not know before that you ever walked this way . ” 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	making	“ I have been making the tour of the park , ” he replied , “ as I generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage .

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	leave	“ Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? ” said she . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	replied	“ He likes to have his own way very well , ” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	speak	I speak feelingly . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	say	“ These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	suffer	But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	said	“ No , ” said Colonel Fitzwilliam , “ that is an advantage which he must divide with me . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	looking	Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ” As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	know	I think I have heard you say that you know them . ” 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	made	It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . She could not think of Darcy ’s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and , agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .

Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	sitting	She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	agent	spent	She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal . On the very last day of the regiment ’s remaining in Meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s and Mr. Darcy ’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	patient	seated	He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	patient	addressing	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ” said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	patient	recommended	It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration , of her former favourite , George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s manners , she 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	patient	watched	Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend Eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out : she watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	patient	marrying	doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind . She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ’s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	patient	bring	She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and , to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him , at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .

Mrs. Phillips	agent	received	She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologizing for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .

Mrs. Phillips	agent	brought	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ” ( for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news ) . 
Mrs. Phillips	agent	stood	Mrs. Philips ’s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ’s good - humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar .

Mr. Hurst	agent	found	Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr. Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who , when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .
