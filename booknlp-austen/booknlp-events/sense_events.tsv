Character	Role	Event	Context
Elinor Dashwood	agent	possessed	Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	had	She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	struggle	Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	exert	Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	consult	She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	returned	It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality . It was contrary to every doctrine of her 's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that Elinor 's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	chanced	She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	think	"I love him already . "" "" I think you will like him , "" said Elinor , "" when you know more of him . "" "" Like him ! "" replied her mother with a smile . "

Elinor Dashwood	agent	draws	It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	has	""" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . "

Elinor Dashwood	agent	replied	""" No taste for drawing ! "" replied Elinor , "" why should you think so ? "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	assure	He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	think	Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	have	I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	declared	Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	wishing	There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	feel	In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	given	Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	consider	She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	knew	A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	feel	With such a knowledge as this , it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	believed	She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	took	She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother 's great expectations , of Mrs. Ferrars 's resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN ; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	gave	She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations . In this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire .

It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	think	The letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . He understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	judge	He earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to Barton Park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether Barton Cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	needed	She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	read	Her resolution was formed as she read . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	wrote	She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance .

Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	oppose	On THAT head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother 's intention of removing into Devonshire . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	made	The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	inhabiting	CHAPTER 5 No sooner was her answer dispatched , than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	turned	"She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , "" Devonshire ! "

"" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	wished	To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	bore	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	said	"When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? "" "" Infirmity ! "" said Elinor , "" do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	suppose	I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	deceive	I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	said	""" "" Perhaps , "" said Elinor , "" thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	think	But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon 's being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	know	""" "" It would be impossible , I know , "" replied Elinor , "" to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	replied	""" "" It would be impossible , I know , "" replied Elinor , "" to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	object	But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	leaving	"Soon after this , upon Elinor 's leaving the room , "" Mamma , "" said Marianne , "" I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	observed	I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	try	"When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? "" CHAPTER 9 The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	rose	The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	said	""" said Elinor . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	said	""" Well , Marianne , "" said Elinor , as soon as he had left them , "" for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	think	""" Well , Marianne , "" said Elinor , as soon as he had left them , "" for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	mean	But I see what you mean . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	saw	In Mrs. Dashwood 's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne 's ; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	approve	, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	saw	She saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ? 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	wish	and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . She liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest .

Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	had	"Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , "" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . "" "

But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	persuaded	To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;-- and Mrs. Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	felt	That the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	placed	He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son . Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby 's service , by her mother . His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs . The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . The old well - established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	found	Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward 's behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . There were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	knew	Sir John 's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world . From such commendation as this , however , there was not much to be learned ; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England , under every possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	sit	She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	say	But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	left	The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	found	Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter , well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton , his family , and all his relations , and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be better acquainted therefore , Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	said	""" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , "" said she , "" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . "

Elinor Dashwood	agent	suppose	""" Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward 's visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention . The letter F-- had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor . "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	expected	The Miss Steeles , as she expected , had now all the benefit of these jokes , and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to , which , though often impertinently expressed , was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	heard	"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . "" Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise . "

Elinor Dashwood	agent	know	The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady 's knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars 's name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	found	CHAPTER 22 Marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill - disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the Miss Steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of Lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments . Lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage .

That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	engage	But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby 's constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne 's situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . A short , a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby 's intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . Marianne 's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	learn	Should the result of her observations be unfavourable , she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister ; should it be otherwise , her exertions would be of a different nature -- she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison , and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	felt	This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	consented	After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings 's side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer 's , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise . Wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	followed	Restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision . It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there .

CHAPTER 28 Nothing occurred during the next three or four days , to make Elinor regret what she had done , in applying to her mother ; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote . They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure .

Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her . At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her .

"" With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness . In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm . She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer . "

Elinor Dashwood	agent	smile	Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars ' power to distress her by it now;-- and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her . She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for Lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both . But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four . Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy . The dinner was a grand one , the servants were numerous , and every thing bespoke the Mistress 's inclination for show , and the Master 's ability to support it . In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate , and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss , nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;-- no poverty of any kind , except of conversation , appeared-- but there , the deficiency was considerable .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	felt	No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor 's office was a painful one.--She 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	believed	going to remove what she really believed to be her sister 's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	practised	She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward 's engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne .

She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;-- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward 's generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings . Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs. Jennings 's persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	prevailed	Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had -- assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings -- given Marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself . Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined . Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night 's rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	love	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.

Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	heard	Lucy 's marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor 's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . 
Elinor Dashwood	agent	heard	How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out .

Elinor Dashwood	agent	set	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.

"" Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , "" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . "" "
Elinor Dashwood	agent	hearing	""" I insist on you hearing the whole of it , "" he replied , "" My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re - establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty-- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice?--or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it .

In this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	offered	The letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	prevented	and the two girls set off together . They gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	scold	I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	obliged	Elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	informed	"I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . "" "" That is to say , "" cried Marianne contemptuously , "" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . "" "" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . "" "" Perhaps , "" said Willoughby , "" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . "" "" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	regarded	Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	attended	Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . Willoughby was out of the question . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	attach	Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	tell	"Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and Margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves . "" Oh , Elinor ! "" she cried , "" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	disposed	""" For such particulars , stated on such authority , Elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	attacked	"When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was Elinor 's particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , Margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , "" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? "" "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	convinced	She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	thrown	Willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of Colonel Brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	informed	Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	flatter	""" "" I flatter myself , "" replied Elinor , "" that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	assure	I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	satisfy	I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	have	"And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? "" "" Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . "" "" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	resolved	You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	startled	I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	loves	"I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . "" Elinor thought this generosity overstrained , considering her sister 's youth , and urged the matter farther , but in vain ; common sense , common care , common prudence , were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood 's romantic delicacy . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	quickened	"I knew how soon he would come . "" She walked eagerly on as she spoke ; and Elinor , to screen Marianne from particularity , as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby , quickened her pace and kept up with her . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	distinguished	On Edward 's side , more particularly , there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion . He was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	mortified	Elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor , endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks . His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection . CHAPTER 17 Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	detected	""" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , "" said Elinor , "" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	distinguished	It was evident that he was unhappy ; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring ; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain ; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	joined	He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast - room the next morning before the others were down ; and Marianne , who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	forced	"But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . "" I think , Edward , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , "" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	prevent	""" "" I think , "" replied Edward , "" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . "" This desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor 's feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue . But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	shutting	Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward 's behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . There were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	assure	However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	see	You ca n't think how much I longed to see you ! 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	blinded	The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	struck	The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady 's knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars 's name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	engaging	CHAPTER 22 Marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill - disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the Miss Steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of Lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments . Lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	eyeing	""" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , "" said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; "" but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	trusted	"And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . ""--She paused . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	forcing	"Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words ; but at length forcing herself to speak , and to speak cautiously , she said , with calmness of manner , which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- "" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ?

Elinor Dashwood	patient	surprised	Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest , at once indisputable and alarming ; and Edward 's visit near Plymouth , his melancholy state of mind , his dissatisfaction at his own prospects , his uncertain behaviour towards herself , the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections , which had often surprised her , the picture , the letter , the ring , formed altogether such a body of evidence , as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly , and established as a fact , which no partiality could set aside , his ill - treatment of herself.--Her 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	deceiving	resentment of such behaviour , her indignation at having been its dupe , for a short time made her feel only for herself ; but other ideas , other considerations , soon arose . Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her ? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel ? 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	deceived	She could not be deceived in that . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	loved	He certainly loved her . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	tempt	How much could it not tempt her to forgive ! 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	injured	In that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	robbed	Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ? The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	marry	If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief ! As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	informed	What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be , but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy 's superior claims on Edward , and be taught to avoid him in future ?

Elinor Dashwood	patient	involve	or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	frighten	"Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward 's future wife , and replied , "" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	called	Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	carried	"It should not , must not be a struggle . "" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	frightened	""" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , "" said Marianne , "" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	reconciled	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical . "

Elinor Dashwood	patient	dissatisfied	when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	find	Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before ! 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	resolved	But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby 's constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne 's situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . A short , a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby 's intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . Marianne 's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	struck	Elinor said no more ; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby ; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was , that , however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair , they must be engaged . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	heard	He heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind . In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	answered	She was answered in the negative . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	obliged	The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements ; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	diverted	Elinor was alternately diverted and pained ; but Marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire , and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere , the certain symptoms 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	grieved	It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	inform	Elinor 's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment 's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	urging	Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	concerned	Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	affected	These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	convinced	Yet as she was convinced that Marianne 's affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon 's success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed . She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	left	Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon 's unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it . CHAPTER 28 Nothing occurred during the next three or four days , to make Elinor regret what she had done , in applying to her mother ; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote . They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure . She sat by the drawing - room fire after tea , till the moment of Lady Middleton 's arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister 's presence ; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected . They arrived in due time at the place of destination , and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow , alighted , ascended the stairs , heard their names announced from one landing - place to another in an audible voice , and entered a room splendidly lit up , quite full of company , and insufferably hot . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	sat	After some time spent in saying little or doing less , Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino , and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and Elinor 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	robbed	Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address , and was unable to say a word . But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	obliged	The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	tranquilize	Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	employed	"Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning 's notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	obliged	"Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , "" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	surprise	"I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . "" "" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	believe	"Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . "" "" Indeed , Ma'am , "" said Elinor , very seriously , "" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . "" "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	seating	Mrs. Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	excuse	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed .

But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	bring	She felt the loss of Willoughby 's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	comforted	But it was a matter of great consolation to her , that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister ; and Elinor , on the other hand , suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely , comforted herself by thinking , that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness ,

Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister 's , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	reached	The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street , and all that reached Elinor of their influence there , strengthened her expectation of the event . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	prepared	"Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , "" Lord !

"" Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	represent	She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward 's engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	persuaded	As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne 's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	dispirited	Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more . Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett 's Buildings . But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	left	An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all Mrs. Jennings 's conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	found	But at last she found herself with some surprise , accosted by Miss Steele , who , though looking rather shy , expressed great satisfaction in meeting them , and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings , left her own party for a short time , to join their 's .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	left	Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	confined	As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	followed	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	shewed	"This delay on the Colonel 's side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , "" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	fixed	The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed .

Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs. Jennings 's persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself . But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs. Jennings 's suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two;--she watched his eyes , while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne 's feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady 's observation;--SHE could 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	believed	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c. 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	tortured	Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne 's side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor 's , before Mr. Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	reproaching	Marianne 's ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	kept	About noon , however , she began -- but with a caution -- a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend -- to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister 's pulse;--she waited , watched , and examined it again and again;--and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	told	Mrs. Jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;-- and Elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	blessed	Half an hour passed away , and the favourable symptom yet blessed her . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	flattered	Others even arose to confirm it . Her breath , her skin , her lips , all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment ; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational , though languid , gaze . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	convinced	The clock struck eight . Had it been ten , Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house ; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID , in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come , that she moved into the adjoining dressing - closet and opened a window shutter , to be satisfied of the truth . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	deceived	She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her .

The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby . CHAPTER 44 Elinor , starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him , obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room , and her hand was already on the lock , when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing , and saying , in a voice rather of command than supplication , "" Miss Dashwood , for half an hour -- for ten minutes-- I entreat you to stay . "" "" No , sir , "" she replied with firmness , "" I shall NOT stay . "

From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said-- "" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "" "" Are you going back to town ? "

Elinor Dashwood	patient	embraced	She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	acquitted	"Willoughby , "" poor Willoughby , "" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . "

Elinor Dashwood	patient	pleased	She saw them in an instant in their parsonage - house ; saw in Lucy , the active , contriving manager , uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality , and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;-- pursuing her own interest in every thought , courting the favour of Colonel Brandon , of Mrs. Jennings , and of every wealthy friend .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	flattered	Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars,--but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings .

Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	had	They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	considered	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	divided	Elinor 's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	left	From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	trust	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	reckoned	"I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . "" "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	tell	""" Well , but Miss Dashwood , "" speaking triumphantly , "" people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars 's declaring he would not have Lucy , for it is no such thing I can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill - natured reports to be spread abroad . Whatever Lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain . "

Elinor Dashwood	patient	ask	""" Well , Miss Dashwood , "" said Mrs. Jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , "" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business .

Elinor Dashwood	patient	encouraging	"He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word "" infection "" to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby 's account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne 's complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris 's report , and confirming Charlotte 's fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood . "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	join	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.

Elinor Dashwood	patient	advise	she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs. Jennings 's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence . 
Elinor Dashwood	patient	pained	"Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . "" Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , "" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . "" "
Elinor Dashwood	patient	marrying	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .

Marianne Dashwood	agent	slighted	"she regarded him with respect and compassion . Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits .

Marianne Dashwood	agent	told	"Marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that Willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman .

That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life !

Marianne Dashwood	agent	had	Elinor , however little concerned in it , joined in their discourse ; and Marianne , who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library , however it might be avoided by the family in general , soon procured herself a book . 
Marianne Dashwood	agent	went	Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had -- assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings -- given Marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself . Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined . Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night 's rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies .

Marianne Dashwood	agent	went	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary . 
Marianne Dashwood	agent	remained	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one .

Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.

Marianne Dashwood	agent	expected	Her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected the most beneficial effects .

Edward 's embarrassment lasted some time , and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled . He was particularly grave the whole morning . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	censured	Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said ; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy , had she known how little offence it had given her sister .

Marianne Dashwood	patient	did	She did her best when thus called on , by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than Miss Lucy .

Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .

Marianne Dashwood	patient	bound	"Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone , though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto-- "" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while .

Marianne Dashwood	patient	tempt	no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	persuading	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical . "
Marianne Dashwood	patient	quit	Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	disappointed	The tea things were brought in , and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door , when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house , Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby 's approach , and Marianne , starting up , moved towards the door . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	throw	"Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , "" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! "" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms , when Colonel Brandon appeared . "
Marianne Dashwood	patient	observed	Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him . She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him , that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room , with such astonishment and concern , as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	induced	After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings 's side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer 's , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise . Wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	dawdled	Restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision . It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	saw	""" But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost . "
Marianne Dashwood	patient	amuse	Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton 's regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	watched	It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	have	"We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . "" "
Marianne Dashwood	patient	given	Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs. Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	told	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation .

Marianne Dashwood	patient	approach	She soon caught his eye , and he immediately bowed , but without attempting to speak to her , or to approach Marianne , though he could not but see her ; and then continued his discourse with the same lady . Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her . At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	observed	"Perhaps he has not observed you yet . "" This however was more than she could believe herself ; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne , it was beyond her wish . She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature . At last he turned round again , and regarded them both ; she started up , and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection , held out her hand to him . He approached , and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne , as if wishing to avoid her eye , and determined not to observe her attitude , inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood , and asked how long they had been in town .

Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	wound	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important .

"" "
Marianne Dashwood	patient	brought	Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	told	When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	divide	"Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . "" Ah ! "

Marianne Dashwood	patient	visiting	She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house , on an excursion through its more immediate premises ; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away , in lounging round the kitchen garden , examining the bloom upon its walls , and listening to the gardener 's lamentations upon blights , in dawdling through the green - house , where the loss of her favourite plants , unwarily exposed , and nipped by the lingering frost , raised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her poultry - yard , where , in the disappointed hopes of her dairy - maid , by hens forsaking their nests , or being stolen by a fox , or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood , she found fresh sources of merriment . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	deterred	The morning was fine and dry , and Marianne , in her plan of employment abroad , had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland . With great surprise therefore , did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner . She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking . Their party was small , and the hours passed quietly away . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	cure	Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had -- assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings -- given Marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself . Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined . Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night 's rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	prove	Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	nursing	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	kept	Marianne was , of course , kept in ignorance of all these arrangements . She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	attended	Mr. Harris , who attended her every day , still talked boldly of a speedy recovery , and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine ; but the expectation of the others 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	see	He tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	rouse	"Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . Mrs. Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper 's room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne . The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out,-- "" Is mama coming?-- "" "" Not yet , "" cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , "" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton . "" "" But she must not go round by London , "" cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner . "" I shall never see her , if she goes by London .

Marianne Dashwood	patient	allow	With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister 's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	oppressed	Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees , and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his assurances , his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation , gave her confidence , comfort , and tears of joy .

He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	robbing	Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	restored	But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .

Marianne Dashwood	patient	seeing	His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor 's conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs. Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel 's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned .

She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat ! But so it was . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	flattered	Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,-- she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	befell	His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	taken	Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover . 
Marianne Dashwood	patient	seeing	The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . 
Edward Ferrars	agent	appeared	It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality . It was contrary to every doctrine of her 's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that Elinor 's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible .

Edward Ferrars	agent	distinguished	His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what . They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche .

Edward Ferrars	agent	form	A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement .

His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs . The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother .

Edward Ferrars	agent	seeking	If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief !

That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important .

Edward Ferrars	agent	said	That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected .

Edward Ferrars	agent	come	She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them . 
Edward Ferrars	agent	remained	She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude . CHAPTER 48 Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence .

Edward Ferrars	agent	felt	What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton , on seeing her mother 's servant , on hearing Lucy 's message ! They would soon , she supposed , be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest ; which she wished to be acquainted with , and yet desired to avoid .

Edward Ferrars	agent	attempt	Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest . 
Edward Ferrars	agent	knew	""" In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy 's letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself . "
Edward Ferrars	agent	heard	"Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon 's being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford--""Which , at present , "" said he , "" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . "" NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . But so little interest had be taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome . "
Edward Ferrars	agent	had	They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life . 
Edward Ferrars	agent	mentioned	"He thus continued : "" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . "
Edward Ferrars	agent	wishes	Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . 
Edward Ferrars	agent	seemed	After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son . 
Edward Ferrars	agent	had	For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again .

Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .

But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	loved	Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered .

Edward Ferrars	patient	captivate	Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	dissuade	I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	starved	"He must be starved , you know;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved . "" "
Edward Ferrars	patient	recollected	Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood 's looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	married	"Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication-- "" I suppose you know , ma'am , that Mr. Ferrars is married . "" "
Edward Ferrars	patient	married	""" Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married , Thomas ? "
Edward Ferrars	patient	see	""" "" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was . "
Edward Ferrars	patient	give	"and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . "" "" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ? "
Edward Ferrars	patient	married	She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude . CHAPTER 48 Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	married	That he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	secure	But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self - provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	get	I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him 
Edward Ferrars	patient	comfort	I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him 
Edward Ferrars	patient	love	Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	fixed	But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	marry	""" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . "" "
Edward Ferrars	patient	allowed	Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ' first tete - a - tete before breakfast . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	induced	Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	preserve	After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son .

Edward Ferrars	patient	robbed	For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again .

Edward Ferrars	patient	visit	Mrs. Jennings 's prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	reconciled	The selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice , and re - established him completely in her favour . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	visited	When Robert first sought her acquaintance , and privately visited her in Bartlett 's Buildings , it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	persuade	He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	tricking	He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother 's consent . What immediately followed is known . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	forgiven	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child . 
Edward Ferrars	patient	judged	It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert 's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange .

John Willoughby	agent	got	Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . 
John Willoughby	agent	drove	He drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . They both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long .

John Willoughby	agent	took	Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods . 
John Willoughby	agent	said	"I know where you spent the morning . "" Marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , "" Where , pray?""-- "" Did not you know , "" said Willoughby , "" that we had been out in my curricle ? "" "" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . "" Marianne turned away in great confusion . "
John Willoughby	agent	propose	Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true . 
John Willoughby	agent	went	""" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . "" "" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . "
John Willoughby	agent	wanted	"They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and-- "" "" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . "" She blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , "" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . "
John Willoughby	agent	says	I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England . 
John Willoughby	agent	lived	His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year ; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal , and he had himself often complained of his poverty .

John Willoughby	agent	loved	The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet . 
John Willoughby	agent	opposed	"One evening in particular , about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country , his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him ; and on Mrs. Dashwood 's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring , he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him . "" What ! "" he exclaimed--""Improve this dear cottage ! "

John Willoughby	agent	went	"It was several days before Willoughby 's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family ; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , indeed , were not so nice ; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;-- but one evening , Mrs. Dashwood , accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare , exclaimed , "" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it .

John Willoughby	agent	meant	But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby 's constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne 's situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . A short , a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby 's intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . Marianne 's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place . 
John Willoughby	agent	produce	"Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , "" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! "" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms , when Colonel Brandon appeared . "
John Willoughby	agent	observed	Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him . She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him , that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room , with such astonishment and concern , as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself . 
John Willoughby	agent	said	""" Is your sister ill ? "" said he . "
John Willoughby	agent	heard	He heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind . In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere .

John Willoughby	agent	replied	"Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last . "" Yes , "" he replied , with some embarrassment , "" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . "
John Willoughby	agent	quitting	This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt . Mrs. Jennings soon came in . 
John Willoughby	agent	call	Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow 
John Willoughby	agent	paid	Elinor 's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment 's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there . 
John Willoughby	agent	calling	The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence . 
John Willoughby	agent	entered	Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it . 
John Willoughby	agent	looked	He looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word .

John Willoughby	agent	came	Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon 's unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .

Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her . At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her .

"" With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness . In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm . She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer . "
John Willoughby	agent	overcome	Absence might have weakened his regard , and convenience might have determined him to overcome it , but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt . 
John Willoughby	agent	written	Mrs. Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's . 
John Willoughby	agent	broken	"For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown over and forgot . And what does talking ever do you know ? "" "" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . "" "" Law , my dear ! "
John Willoughby	agent	gain	Elinor , for her sister 's sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby 's ; since , though Marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth . 
John Willoughby	agent	followed	In one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from Willoughby , full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed , satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself , rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes , the assurances of his letter . The work of one moment was destroyed by the next .

From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said-- "" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off .

John Willoughby	patient	question	Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before .

John Willoughby	patient	assigned	Elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon .

John Willoughby	patient	included	In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection . 
John Willoughby	patient	cheated	If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . 
John Willoughby	patient	bred	"Marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that Willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . Without considering that it was not in her mother 's plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures .

John Willoughby	patient	called	The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet .

John Willoughby	patient	respecting	""" Mrs. Palmer 's information respecting Willoughby was not very material ; but any testimony in his favour , however small , was pleasing to her . "
John Willoughby	patient	finding	But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby 's constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne 's situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . A short , a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby 's intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . Marianne 's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place . 
John Willoughby	patient	seeing	Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him .

John Willoughby	patient	seen	Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it . 
John Willoughby	patient	let	But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing . 
John Willoughby	patient	convinced	I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . 
John Willoughby	patient	Excuse	Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . 
John Willoughby	patient	Tell	"Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . "" "
John Willoughby	patient	perceived	They had not remained in this manner long , before Elinor perceived Willoughby , standing within a few yards of them , in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman . 
John Willoughby	patient	perceived	She soon caught his eye , and he immediately bowed , but without attempting to speak to her , or to approach Marianne , though he could not but see her ; and then continued his discourse with the same lady . Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her . At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her . 
John Willoughby	patient	find	""" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . "
John Willoughby	patient	naming	"But I shall see them tomorrow . "" "" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings "
John Willoughby	patient	defend	Do n't pretend to defend him . 
John Willoughby	patient	put	"If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head ! "" "" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma'am , "" said Elinor , "" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . "
John Willoughby	patient	justify	""" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . "" He made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea - things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped . "
John Willoughby	patient	acquitting	Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him . 
John Willoughby	patient	marry	Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . 
John Willoughby	patient	reclaim	To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . 
John Willoughby	patient	seen	"Have you , "" she continued , after a short silence , "" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? "
John Willoughby	patient	placing	Against the interest of her own individual comfort , Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where , at that time , than at Barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing Willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there . She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks .

She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks . 
John Willoughby	patient	seeing	From all danger of seeing Willoughby again , her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country , since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends . 
John Willoughby	patient	force	Design could never bring them in each other 's way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs. Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one . She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother . 
John Willoughby	patient	married	THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good - will towards himself , and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but Mrs. Jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of Midsummer , they would not be married till Michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all . The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs. Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars . Early in February , within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby 's letter , Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married . 
John Willoughby	patient	saw	"All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings 's maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs . The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby . CHAPTER 44 Elinor , starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him , obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room , and her hand was already on the lock , when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing , and saying , in a voice rather of command than supplication , "" Miss Dashwood , for half an hour -- for ten minutes-- I entreat you to stay . "" "" No , sir , "" she replied with firmness , "" I shall NOT stay . "
John Willoughby	patient	told	""" Had they told me , "" he cried with vehemence , "" that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . "

John Willoughby	patient	hear	The possibility of Colonel Brandon 's arriving and finding her there , came across her . But she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged .

John Willoughby	patient	obliged	When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before .

John Willoughby	patient	justify	I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . 
John Willoughby	patient	defend	If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself . 
John Willoughby	patient	rousing	"Willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : "" Well , let me make haste and be gone . "
John Willoughby	patient	rousing	"The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said-- "" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "" "" Are you going back to town ? "
John Willoughby	patient	call	"Willoughby , "" poor Willoughby , "" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . "

John Willoughby	patient	wished	She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death . 
John Willoughby	patient	proved	"Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . "
John Willoughby	patient	saw	"The sisters set out at a pace , slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill , the important hill behind , when pausing with her eyes turned towards it , Marianne calmly said , "" There , exactly there,""--pointing with one hand , "" on that projecting mound,--there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby "
John Willoughby	patient	forget	As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . 
John Willoughby	patient	supposed	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . 
John Willoughby	patient	changed	Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . 
John Willoughby	patient	acquit	Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you . 
John Willoughby	patient	justified	"Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? "" "" No , Marianne , in no possible way . "" "" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh ! "
John Willoughby	patient	restore	But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished , to Marianne . 
John Willoughby	patient	replace	Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon .

Lucy Steele	agent	wept	If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief ! As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself . 
Lucy Steele	agent	thought	Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters .

Lucy Steele	agent	appeared	But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects . 
Lucy Steele	agent	think	""" THAT was exactly like Robert,""--was his immediate observation.--""And THAT , "" he presently added , "" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began .

Lucy Steele	agent	gave	In that point , however , and that only , he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME , another visit , another conversation , was always wanted to produce this conviction . 
Lucy Steele	agent	betrayed	Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother . 
Lucy Steele	agent	had	They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;-- and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at Lucy 's instigation , was adopted .

Lucy Steele	agent	remained	The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned . 
Lucy Steele	agent	became	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child . 
Lucy Steele	agent	meant	""" In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy 's letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself . "
Lucy Steele	patient	tell	""" Upon my word , "" replied Elinor , "" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . "
Lucy Steele	patient	pitied	Elinor saw , and pitied her for , the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable ; but she saw , with less tenderness of feeling , the thorough want of delicacy , of rectitude , and integrity of mind , which her attentions , her assiduities , her flatteries at the Park betrayed ; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company 
Lucy Steele	patient	tell	"Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? "" "" No , "" returned Elinor , cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward 's mother , and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity-- "" I know nothing of her . "" "

Lucy Steele	patient	command	Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters . 
Lucy Steele	patient	divide	And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house . 
Lucy Steele	patient	obliged	The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be .

That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John 's joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and

Lucy Steele	patient	convince	She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival 's intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded . 
Lucy Steele	patient	engaging	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise . 
Lucy Steele	patient	engaging	The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy 's attention to attempt it . They quitted it only with the removal of the tea - things . 
Lucy Steele	patient	recollected	"This hint was enough , Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied , "" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . "
Lucy Steele	patient	resolved	I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . 
Lucy Steele	patient	reseated	Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child .

Lucy Steele	patient	blame	"But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me .

Lucy Steele	patient	deprive	, it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward 's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . 
Lucy Steele	patient	deceived	"I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . "" "" All this , "" thought Elinor , "" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . "" "" But what , "" said she after a short silence , "" are your views ? "
Lucy Steele	patient	wrong	"You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . "" "" Indeed you wrong me , "" replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; "" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately .

She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne 's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .

Lucy Steele	patient	meet	In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make .

Lucy Steele	patient	keep	And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself . I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be .

Lucy Steele	patient	surprise	So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . 
Lucy Steele	patient	avail	As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry . 
Lucy Steele	patient	visit	It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford;--a place , in which , of all others , she would now least chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings , but even Lucy , when they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there . 
Lucy Steele	patient	marrying	She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude . CHAPTER 48 Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence . 
Lucy Steele	patient	married	Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . 
Lucy Steele	patient	chusing	But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny . 
Lucy Steele	patient	borrowed	"Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- "" I do think , "" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again .

Mrs. Jennings	agent	overcome	, was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike .

Mrs. Jennings	agent	thought	He was nice in his eating , uncertain in his hours ; fond of his child , though affecting to slight it ; and idled away the mornings at billiards , which ought to have been devoted to business . She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;-- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward 's generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings . Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs. Jennings 's persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself . But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs. Jennings 's suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two;--she watched his eyes , while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne 's feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady 's observation;--SHE could

Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne 's complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris 's report , and confirming Charlotte 's fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood . "
Mrs. Jennings	agent	declared	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.

Mrs. Jennings	agent	determined	Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it , and Colonel Brandon , who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings 's forebodings , was not in a state of mind to resist their influence .

Mrs. Jennings	agent	trust	Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety . 
Mrs. Jennings	agent	persuaded	Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother 's arrival , and allow HER to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant . 
Mrs. Jennings	agent	attending	Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep . The night was cold and stormy .

Mrs. Jennings	agent	send	I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him 
Mrs. Jennings	agent	believed	Mrs. Jennings 's prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	enabled	She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	convinced	She was perfectly convinced of it . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	supplied	The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable , for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	clear	Mrs. Dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	value	I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	accompany	Towards this home , she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	favour	I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	put	Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	say	""" "" Nay , "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	bless	Lord bless me ! 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	abandoned	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	forced	"Colonel , "" said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , "" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner !

Mrs. Jennings	patient	commissioned	"I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . "" "" Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . "" "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	prevent	""" At any rate , "" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , "" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	attend	The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	find	""" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	come	Marianne was in a silent agony , too much oppressed even for tears ; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home , they could go directly to their own room , where hartshorn restored her a little to herself . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	attending	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	seeing	Mrs. Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	told	Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	grieves	""" Poor soul ! "" cried Mrs. Jennings , as soon as she was gone , "" how it grieves me to see her ! "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	Mind	Mind me , now , if they an't married by Mid - summer . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	struck	"Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne , Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence . Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea - table where Elinor presided , and whispered-- "" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	assured	"He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . "" He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her 's , and , with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information , inquired after her sister . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	governed	Thus a circumstance occurred , while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast , which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation ; because , through her own weakness , it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself , though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	reproach	The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort .

Mrs. Jennings	patient	met	""" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , "" said he , after the first salutation , "" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	commission	THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good - will towards himself , and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but Mrs. Jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of Midsummer , they would not be married till Michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all . The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs. Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars . Early in February , within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby 's letter , Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	see	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	carried	The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs. Jennings away . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	dressed	This event , highly important to Mrs. Jennings 's happiness , produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time , and influenced , in a like degree , the engagements of her young friends ; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte , she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed , and did not return till late in the evening ; and the Miss Dashwoods , at the particular request of the Middletons , spent the whole of every day , in every day in Conduit Street . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	plagued	Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	tell	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	induced	This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	know	"Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;""--was Mrs. Jennings 's address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled--""for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord ! "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	keep	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	commended	She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	confined	"Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , "" Lord ! what should hinder it?""--but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . "" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . "" "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	puzzled	"It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . "" This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	met	He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	put	am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	persuade	""" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! "" "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	told	""" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , "" said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , "" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	assure	"I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . "" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . CHAPTER 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . "
Mrs. Jennings	patient	joined	Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	affront	, was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	love	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.

Mrs. Jennings	patient	called	Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne 's side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor 's , before Mr. Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	keep	Mrs. Jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;-- and Elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	joined	At seven o'clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing - room to tea . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	satisfy	Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep . The night was cold and stormy . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	summoned	The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford . 
Mrs. Jennings	patient	vent	"Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- "" I do think , "" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	considered	And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount . It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little Harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ? 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	returned	""" "" Certainly , "" returned Mrs. John Dashwood . "
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	say	And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	remained	Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ;

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	determined	Against the interest of her own individual comfort , Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where , at that time , than at Barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing Willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there . She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	hoped	A variety of occupations , of objects , and of company , which could not be procured at Barton , would be inevitable there , and might yet , she hoped , cheat Marianne , at times , into some interest beyond herself , and even into some amusement , much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	judged	Design could never bring them in each other 's way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs. Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one . She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	waited	"But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	had	As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister , his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else ; and a thought struck him during the evening , which he communicated to his wife , for her approbation , when they got home . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	seemed	Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her , herself ; cherishing all her hopes , and promoting all her views ! 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	do	So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . ' 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	declared	Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	said	""" If he would only have done as well by himself , "" said John Dashwood , "" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody 's power to assist him .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	left	I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	quitted	After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	proceeded	She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	produced	Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne 's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	recovered	She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	sit	Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	added	""" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , "" added Mrs. Dashwood , "" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	persuaded	His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor 's conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs. Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel 's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	began	At the end of another day or two , Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours , Mrs. Dashwood , urged equally by her own and her daughter 's wishes , began to talk of removing to Barton . 
Mrs. Dashwood	agent	followed	The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	explained	Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor . It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other 's acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment .

Mrs. Dashwood	agent	desired	Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ? 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	despise	So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother

Mrs. Dashwood	patient	installed	CHAPTER 2 Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland ; and her mother and sisters - in - law were degraded to the condition of visitors . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	accommodate	He really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider Norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	reminded	A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	carried	In seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself . But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy .

Mrs. Dashwood	patient	give	Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	informed	Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	support	She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	reproached	For their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	convinced	His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	called	She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	indulged	CHAPTER 5 No sooner was her answer dispatched , than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	show	To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	interested	No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed .

Mrs. Dashwood	patient	commanded	The prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	met	Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	attended	She thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	obliged	Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	persuaded	To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;-- and Mrs. Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	taught	So far it was all as she had foreseen ; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	detain	"But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "" He coloured as he replied , "" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . "
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	disturbed	Willoughby 's behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother 's invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	satisfied	But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them , which at least satisfied herself . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	offend	"But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . "" "" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times . "

Mrs. Dashwood	patient	delighted	""" I am delighted with the plan , "" she cried , "" it is exactly what I could wish . "
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	brought	Design could never bring them in each other 's way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs. Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one . She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother .

Mrs. Dashwood	patient	recommended	There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides , which mutually attracted them ; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor , and a general want of understanding . The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband 's sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	befell	I come now to the relation of a misfortune , which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	obliged	In the present instance , this last - arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability , that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods , and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood 's sisters , she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street ; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards , cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister , to a small musical party at her house . The consequence of which was , that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods , but , what was still worse , must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention : and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time ?

Mrs. Dashwood	patient	persuade	Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	astonished	John Dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	disliked	, was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	denied	Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	attended	She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	fetch	Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of:-- he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	supported	She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger .

As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	take	The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	sent	But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	persuaded	His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor 's conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs. Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel 's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	prevailed	At his and Mrs. Jennings 's united request in return , Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back , for the better accommodation of her sick child ; and the Colonel , at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings , whose active good - nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself , engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage , in the course of a few weeks . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	shocked	Mrs. Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant 's inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor 's countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne 's situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	left	When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence . 
Mrs. Dashwood	patient	wo	She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude . CHAPTER 48 Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence .

Mrs. Dashwood	patient	think	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town .

Colonel Brandon	agent	had	"Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him .

Colonel Brandon	agent	looked	His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor 's conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation . Mrs. Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel 's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned . 
Colonel Brandon	agent	assisted	The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford .

Colonel Brandon	patient	befallen	CHAPTER 14 The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon 's visit at the park , with his steadiness in concealing its cause , filled the mind , and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days ; she was a great wonderer , as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance . She wondered , with little intermission what could be the reason of it ; was sure there must be some bad news , and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him , with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	sent	I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? 
Colonel Brandon	patient	distressed	It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	met	""" My dear Mrs. Palmer ! "" "" Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . "
Colonel Brandon	patient	met	When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	seeing	From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	informed	He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	announced	Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	spared	""" What did you hear ? "" "" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged -- but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . "
Colonel Brandon	patient	brought	""" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "" The event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for Colonel Brandon DID come in ; and Elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither , and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly . "

"
Colonel Brandon	patient	avoiding	Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of Willoughby , and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible . But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	observed	His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations , was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him , and the gentleness of her voice whenever ( though it did not often happen ) she was obliged , or could oblige herself to speak to him . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	assured	THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good - will towards himself , and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but Mrs. Jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of Midsummer , they would not be married till Michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all . The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs. Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars . Early in February , within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby 's letter , Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	eyed	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	observed	I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	secures	A very little trouble on your side secures him . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	advise	Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	fix	But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	marrying	"I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect . "
Colonel Brandon	patient	secure	Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise , and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon , who , always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were , received his eager civilities with some surprise , but much more pleasure . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	prompted	The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	said	"Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . "" What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , "" Colonel Brandon ! "" "" Yes , "" continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , "" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . "
Colonel Brandon	patient	esteems	I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	find	"He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . "" "" Indeed , "" replied Elinor , "" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this . "
Colonel Brandon	patient	worship	As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry .

Colonel Brandon	patient	astonished	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	reason	He tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more .

Colonel Brandon	patient	offered	Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of:-- he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	thanked	She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris , and an order for post - horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	remembering	She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death .

Colonel Brandon	patient	tell	Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	brought	On HER measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs. Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ' stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable .

Colonel Brandon	patient	brought	A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne 's looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother 's language , to make it cheerful . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	bringing	Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	loved	Colonel Brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation , and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his , was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend .

Colonel Brandon	patient	enjoy	That his repentance of misconduct , which thus brought its own punishment , was sincere , need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy , and of Marianne with regret . But that he was for ever inconsolable , that he fled from society , or contracted an habitual gloom of temper , or died of a broken heart , must not be depended on -- for he did neither . He lived to exert , and frequently to enjoy himself . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	interested	His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	regarded	To the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel 's advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	tell	"He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . "" He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her 's , and , with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information , inquired after her sister . "
Colonel Brandon	patient	told	"Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . "" I have heard , "" said he , with great compassion , "" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- "" Elinor told him that it was . "
Colonel Brandon	patient	touch	It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . 
Colonel Brandon	patient	send	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c. 
Colonel Brandon	patient	beg	"Colonel , "" said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , "" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner !

Sir John Middleton	agent	described	The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . 
Sir John Middleton	agent	visited	each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . Marianne 's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and Elinor 's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to Barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty . He had formerly visited at Stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . His countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . 
Sir John Middleton	agent	said	He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence .

Sir John Middleton	agent	left	His kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . 
Sir John Middleton	agent	insisted	He insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day .

Sir John Middleton	agent	had	The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor .

Sir John Middleton	agent	attended	Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . 
Sir John Middleton	agent	said	They would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay .

Sir John Middleton	agent	hoped	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave .

Sir John Middleton	agent	mentioned	The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady 's knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars 's name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John . 
Sir John Middleton	agent	mentioned	She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . 
Sir John Middleton	agent	called	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .

Sir John Middleton	agent	met	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation .

In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to Barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty . He had formerly visited at Stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him .

Lady Middleton	agent	resigned	As it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day . 
Lady Middleton	agent	declared	She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration . 
Lady Middleton	agent	happened	With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight .

Lady Middleton	agent	saw	She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment .

Lady Middleton	agent	took	Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted , which was putting herself rather out of her way ; and as for the Miss Steeles , especially Lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them . 
Lady Middleton	agent	approve	Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve . 
Lady Middleton	agent	given	In the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in London , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side - board collation . Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance . 
Lady Middleton	agent	waited	Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon 's unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .

They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure . She sat by the drawing - room fire after tea , till the moment of Lady Middleton 's arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister 's presence ; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected . They arrived in due time at the place of destination , and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow , alighted , ascended the stairs , heard their names announced from one landing - place to another in an audible voice , and entered a room splendidly lit up , quite full of company , and insufferably hot .

Lady Middleton	agent	appeared	There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides , which mutually attracted them ; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor , and a general want of understanding . The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband 's sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence .

Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister 's , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them . 
Lady Middleton	agent	suppose	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . 
Lady Middleton	agent	celebrated	In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it .

In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm .

Thomas Palmer	agent	feel	Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer , and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself , that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family . She found him , however , perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors , and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother ; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion , and only prevented from being so always , by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general , as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte . For the rest of his character and habits , they were marked , as far as Elinor could perceive , with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life . 
Thomas Palmer	agent	meant	He was nice in his eating , uncertain in his hours ; fond of his child , though affecting to slight it ; and idled away the mornings at billiards , which ought to have been devoted to business .

Fanny Dashwood	patient	having	"I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect . "
Fanny Dashwood	patient	prepossessed	Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . 
Fanny Dashwood	patient	carry	"But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . "" CHAPTER 34 Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband 's judgment , that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter ; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former , even the woman with whom her sisters were staying , by no means unworthy her notice ; and as for Lady Middleton , she found her one of the most charming women in the world !

Fanny Dashwood	patient	induced	Elinor wanted very much to know , though she did not chuse to ask , whether Edward was then in town ; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her , till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on , or till her husband 's expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered ; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other , that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion . The intelligence however , which SHE would not give , soon flowed from another quarter . 
Fanny Dashwood	patient	provoked	"But SHE does every thing well . "" Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars ; and such ill - timed praise of another , at Elinor 's expense , though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it , provoked her immediately to say with warmth , "" This is admiration of a very particular kind!-- what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows , or who cares , for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak .

Fanny Dashwood	patient	impoverished	Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished . 
Fanny Dashwood	patient	enrich	But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny . 
Fanny Dashwood	patient	think	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town .

Margaret Dashwood	agent	left	The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . 
Margaret Dashwood	agent	related	Margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . 
Margaret Dashwood	agent	communicated	"Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and Margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves .

Margaret Dashwood	agent	answered	"When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was Elinor 's particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , Margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , "" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ?

Margaret Dashwood	agent	fixed	She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings . 
Margaret Dashwood	agent	have	"Marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret , "" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . "" "

"" "" Margaret , "" said Marianne with great warmth , "" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . "" "" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. "" Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing , at this moment , "" that it rained very hard , "" though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship 's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . The idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them .

Margaret Dashwood	agent	returned	Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future .

Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward . 
Margaret Dashwood	agent	thought	Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight , to conceal her distress ; and Margaret , understanding some part , but not the whole of the case , thought it incumbent on her to be dignified , and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could , and maintained a strict silence . 
Margaret Dashwood	agent	reached	Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover .

Margaret Dashwood	patient	fetch	The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection . 
Margaret Dashwood	patient	think	Mrs. Dashwood 's and Elinor 's appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before .
