Emma Woodhouse	agent	speak	the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella 's marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . How was she to bear the change?--It

And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .

Emma Woodhouse	agent	make	Not unfrequently , through Emma 's persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . 
Emma Woodhouse	agent	found	She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse 's kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .

Emma Woodhouse	agent	foreseen	Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet 's age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton 's return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .

When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case . 
Emma Woodhouse	agent	observed	She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet .

Emma Woodhouse	agent	came	He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _ her _ .

Emma Woodhouse	agent	felt	""" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . "

Emma Woodhouse	agent	felt	He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character .

A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no

Emma Woodhouse	agent	removed	Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend 's approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.-- 
Emma Woodhouse	agent	acknowledge	But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet 's 
Emma Woodhouse	agent	preparing	She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . 
Emma Woodhouse	agent	acknowledged	No objection was raised on the father 's side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	deceived	I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	incline	Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet 's share . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	induce	"After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again-- "" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!""-- Emma laughed , and replied , "" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	convinced	But between _ us _ , I am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	suit	"This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	separate	Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	bringing	But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet 's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	obliged	Mr. Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	put	She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	obliged	Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	obliged	It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	flatter	""" Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	welcome	had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	addressing	Emma 's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	interested	Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	addressing	After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible ! 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	Believe	Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	obliged	The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _ he _ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	surprized.--Mr	"The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton 's best compliments , "" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	considered	There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time -- tiresome women-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	prepared	Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet 's being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	amused	She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !

Emma Woodhouse	patient	inclined	""" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , "" said Emma ; "" she is a very elegant young woman . "" He agreed to it , but with so quiet a "" Yes , "" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	direct	""" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . "" "" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	patient	considering	It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	taken	very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	betrayed	As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	finding	Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	attach	And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	struck	She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	believed	It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	convinced	She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant 's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	tempt	Nothing should tempt _ her _ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father 's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	tempted	She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	disturbed	She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole 's ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	hand	She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole 's door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley 's ; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma 's opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey . She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	thanked	""" This is coming as you should do , "" said she ; "" like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . "" He thanked her , observing , "" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! "
Emma Woodhouse	patient	meet	; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	received	She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	approached	When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side . The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr. Cox 's family , the lawyer of Highbury .

She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire-- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and

Emma Woodhouse	patient	suited	Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	took	She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well . One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill . Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	struck	They talked at first only of the performance . His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs. Weston , it would not have struck her . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	led	Mrs. Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	attended	"After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston , look sorrowful , and have done . "" Perhaps it is as well , "" said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage . "
Emma Woodhouse	patient	repent	CHAPTER IX Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	supposed	The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	interrupted	She was then interrupted by Harriet 's coming in ; and if Harriet 's praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	informed	Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	told	He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	seeing	The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	reason	That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	convinced	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	required	CHAPTER XV Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton . Her observation had been pretty correct . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	left	The change on Mrs. Elton 's side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton , nor , under Mrs. Elton 's guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	exposed	They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	comfort	She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	satisfy	A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	convinced	She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	seeing	There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	told	Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends-- for the house was taken for May and June . She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	considering	He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	gone	Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	eyeing	This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	giving	"It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . "" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? "" said Mr. Weston . "
Emma Woodhouse	patient	disturbed	Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	observing	She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	enabled	It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	told	She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning . He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	convince	Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	struck	Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	tell	"The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital . CHAPTER IV A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began : "" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	asking	Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	decided	"She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.-- She was decided , and thus spoke-- "" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	scorned	Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	amuse	To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	told	If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	prevent	She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	ushered	She heard Miss Bates 's voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	told	"But Miss Bates soon came--""Very happy and obliged""--but Emma 's conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	struck	"The contrast between Mrs. Churchill 's importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax 's , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman 's destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates 's saying , "" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	obliged	"I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties . '-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter 's . "" Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	take	To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	blessed	Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	led	How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! What blindness , what madness , had led her on ! 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	struck	It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	made	Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	convinced	Circumstances that might swell to half an hour 's relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . ) 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	saved	"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . "
Emma Woodhouse	patient	seen	""" She could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go;""--with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma 's feelings : "" Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! "" "
Emma Woodhouse	patient	accompanied	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	leave	Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured ? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet 's sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet 's society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma 's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ? When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	deserving	There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	dissuade	She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person 's company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston , best in the world . Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	reminded	She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	class	Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes

Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	admired	And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	took	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	mention	With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.--She 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	take	You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	have	While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .

Emma Woodhouse	patient	occasioned	Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle 's generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	see	If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	met	I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	spoke	I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W. , as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	calling	Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- ` Jane , ' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	satisfy	but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness.--I 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	command	but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at-- : in short , the full direction to Mr. Smallridge 's , near Bristol , stared me in the face . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	required	But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father 's happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . 
Emma Woodhouse	patient	leaving	Some might think him , and others might think her , the most in luck . One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage.--There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction .

George Knightley	agent	continued	To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father 's account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls . 
George Knightley	agent	settled	"He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus-- "" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?

George Knightley	agent	stept	Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .

It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr. Elton 's wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service .

George Knightley	agent	like	hear whatever you like . 
George Knightley	agent	impute	Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his . 
George Knightley	agent	remained	As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them , Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and Harriet . 
George Knightley	agent	ask	She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought . 
George Knightley	agent	lived	While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more-- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet 's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children.-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .

George Knightley	patient	inclined	""" I can not rate her beauty as you do , "" said he ; "" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman . "

George Knightley	patient	consult	He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it . 
George Knightley	patient	ask	He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends . He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _ your _ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . 
George Knightley	patient	observed	He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley 's pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . 
George Knightley	patient	named	John , the second , is named after his father .

George Knightley	patient	procuring	Emma 's sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation . 
George Knightley	patient	consult	"This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and "" How d'ye do , George ? "" and "" John , how are you ? "" succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .

George Knightley	patient	see	"I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . "" Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it .

George Knightley	patient	brought	"Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable ?

"" There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed . In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man-- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr. Knightley .

George Knightley	patient	delights	Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . 
George Knightley	patient	cooled	If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary . 
George Knightley	patient	keep	She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . 
George Knightley	patient	influenced	He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act . 
George Knightley	patient	watched	She watched him well . 
George Knightley	patient	satisfy	Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury . 
George Knightley	patient	trusting	She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long . 
George Knightley	patient	declared	That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls . Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago . He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father 's doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .

George Knightley	patient	caught	In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . 
George Knightley	patient	invited	Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .

George Knightley	patient	accompany	"Jane Fairfax 's perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , "" I did not know that proper names were allowed , "" pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered .

George Knightley	patient	irritated	That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse 's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey . CHAPTER VI After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling , the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn . 
George Knightley	patient	assure	What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston .

George Knightley	patient	promised	She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it . 
George Knightley	patient	obliged	Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come . In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing exactly right .

George Knightley	patient	used	"He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , "" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I can not see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance . "

George Knightley	patient	see	She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . 
George Knightley	patient	let	""" No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . "
George Knightley	patient	tell	Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going-- her father began his inquiries . 
George Knightley	patient	used	Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case . 
George Knightley	patient	consider	; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter 's becoming known to her-- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it-- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it.-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr. Knightley.-- Every other part of her mind was disgusting . With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body 's feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body 's destiny . 
George Knightley	patient	opposing	She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them . 
George Knightley	patient	expressed	She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not 
George Knightley	patient	overrating	too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _ her_.--Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage , in fact , would not do for her .

George Knightley	patient	expected	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded . 
George Knightley	patient	returned	, with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .

George Knightley	patient	gone	As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them , Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and Harriet . 
George Knightley	patient	offered	"He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , "" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference .

George Knightley	patient	marry	"The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma 's answer was ready at the first word . "" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her . "
George Knightley	patient	deceive	He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father 's comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . 
George Knightley	patient	received	But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father 's happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . 
George Knightley	patient	advised	She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . 
George Knightley	patient	forgotten	In time , of course , Mr. Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early .

Harriet Smith	agent	think	Neither would Mr. Knightley 's downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _ him _ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable .

Harriet Smith	agent	lived	As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard 's ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech . 
Harriet Smith	agent	brought	She brought no name , no blood , no alliance . 
Harriet Smith	agent	feared	she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . 
Harriet Smith	agent	having	She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other . 
Harriet Smith	agent	hearing	She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet 's mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other . 
Harriet Smith	agent	dared	Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .

Harriet Smith	agent	forget	"Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me . "" This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .

Harriet Smith	agent	going	Mrs. Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet 's going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _ recollecting _ . 
Harriet Smith	agent	behaved	Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent . 
Harriet Smith	agent	said	"The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be .

Harriet Smith	agent	happening	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match .

Harriet Smith	agent	had	Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about . 
Harriet Smith	agent	seemed	His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .

Harriet Smith	agent	leaning	Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened .

Harriet Smith	agent	follow	Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies . A child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury . But poor Harriet could not follow .

Harriet Smith	agent	opened	It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield .

Harriet Smith	agent	saying	""" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . "
Harriet Smith	agent	removed	While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more-- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet 's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children.-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .

Harriet Smith	agent	expressed	Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella 's invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss .

Harriet Smith	agent	accepted	""" I am quite sure , "" he replied , speaking very distinctly , "" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . "
Harriet Smith	agent	thank	Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for . 
Harriet Smith	agent	dwell	Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley 's , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . 
Harriet Smith	agent	proved	She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . 
Harriet Smith	agent	marrying	Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong-- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been . 
Harriet Smith	agent	had	How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton 's being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.-- Alas !

Harriet Smith	patient	bring	As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .

Harriet Smith	patient	loved	Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . 
Harriet Smith	patient	tell	She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . 
Harriet Smith	patient	encouraged	"Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin 's having "" _ two _ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard 's drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs. Martin 's saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _ her _ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea:--a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people .

Harriet Smith	patient	amused	For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose . 
Harriet Smith	patient	required	She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son 's wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .

Harriet Smith	patient	struck	I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin .

Harriet Smith	patient	known	She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school . 
Harriet Smith	patient	taught	She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself .

Harriet Smith	patient	turn	Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . 
Harriet Smith	patient	describe	Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess . 
Harriet Smith	patient	puff	You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her .

Harriet Smith	patient	engaged	It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet 's fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .

Harriet Smith	patient	getting	They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more . 
Harriet Smith	patient	told	It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .

Harriet Smith	patient	excluded	Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears . 
Harriet Smith	patient	attend	Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard 's unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton 's would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together .

Harriet Smith	patient	entreat	But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet's -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _ promise _ _ him _ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was vexed .

Harriet Smith	patient	acknowledge	She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman 's return . She went to Mrs. Goddard 's accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred-- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of Harriet 's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . 
Harriet Smith	patient	consider	Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . 
Harriet Smith	patient	resemble	Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma 's eyes-- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father 's claims , was to promote Harriet 's comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . 
Harriet Smith	patient	got	She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts . 
Harriet Smith	patient	amuse	She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts . 
Harriet Smith	patient	prove	Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet 's age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton 's return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . 
Harriet Smith	patient	saw	Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself . 
Harriet Smith	patient	obliged	Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet 's being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties . 
Harriet Smith	patient	lose	Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry . 
Harriet Smith	patient	knowing	"Harriet said , "" very true , "" and she "" would not think about it ; "" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr. Elton 's importance with her ! "
Harriet Smith	patient	seeking	As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard 's ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech .

Harriet Smith	patient	defying	He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith . 
Harriet Smith	patient	used	Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol-- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained-- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . 
Harriet Smith	patient	talked	She had talked her into love ; but , alas ! 
Harriet Smith	patient	cure	she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . 
Harriet Smith	patient	take	She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .

Harriet Smith	patient	had	CHAPTER V Small heart had Harriet for visiting . 
Harriet Smith	patient	led	Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard 's , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _ The _ _ Rev. _ _ Philip _ _ Elton _ , _ White - Hart _ , _ Bath _ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher 's cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank . 
Harriet Smith	patient	received	They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time-- till just at last , when Mrs. Martin 's saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner . In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends . There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _ He _ had done it .

Harriet Smith	patient	left	The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort . 
Harriet Smith	patient	advised	"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that "" of course it must be declined , "" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it-- so much consideration for her father . "" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . "" "
Harriet Smith	patient	approach	"Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her . She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . "" "
Harriet Smith	patient	hear	"I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . "" "" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . "
Harriet Smith	patient	joined	Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . At last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel .

Harriet Smith	patient	succeeding	"His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the "" beautiful little friend , "" suggested to her the idea of Harriet 's succeeding her in his affections . "
Harriet Smith	patient	attacked	At last Emma attacked her on another ground . 
Harriet Smith	patient	deceive	You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.--Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you-- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . 
Harriet Smith	patient	exert	"Emma continued , "" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . "
Harriet Smith	patient	save	I want you to save yourself from greater pain . 
Harriet Smith	patient	loved	, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before . 
Harriet Smith	patient	surprized	""" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . "" "" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . "" "" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . "" "
Harriet Smith	patient	called	"He called her ` Augusta . ' How delightful ! "" When the visit was returned , Emma made up her mind . She could then see more and judge better . "
Harriet Smith	patient	disgraced	Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . 
Harriet Smith	patient	convey	Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man 's company . She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them . 
Harriet Smith	patient	ask	He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . 
Harriet Smith	patient	leading	In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . 
Harriet Smith	patient	marry	, you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet . 
Harriet Smith	patient	obliged	She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless-- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain . 
Harriet Smith	patient	assailed	How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more . In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury-- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .

Harriet Smith	patient	bring	It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place . 
Harriet Smith	patient	see	This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself . 
Harriet Smith	patient	setting	"The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital . CHAPTER IV A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began : "" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over . "
Harriet Smith	patient	begged	Emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak . 
Harriet Smith	patient	understand	I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . 
Harriet Smith	patient	fancying	""" Yes , "" said Emma , "" I hope I do . "" "" How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . . "" cried Harriet , warmly . "" "
Harriet Smith	patient	took	""" Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . "
Harriet Smith	patient	rid	"I must get rid of every thing.-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . "" "" And when , "" thought Emma , "" will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? "" She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _ told _ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly . "
Harriet Smith	patient	advise	"She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , "" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so""--and thought no more of it , till after a minute 's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , "" I shall never marry . "" "
Harriet Smith	patient	drive	Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances 
Harriet Smith	patient	rendered	"The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . "" "" Service ! "
Harriet Smith	patient	advise	I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet .

Harriet Smith	patient	see	Now they seemed in pleasant conversation . There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not .

Harriet Smith	patient	directed	"Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--""But , with common sense , "" she added , "" I am afraid I have had little to do .

Harriet Smith	patient	misunderstood	"Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma 's . "" I should not have thought it possible , "" she began , "" that you could have misunderstood me !

Harriet Smith	patient	encourage	And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him .

Harriet Smith	patient	asking	( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley 's coming and asking me to dance , when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room . 
Harriet Smith	patient	led	Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less . 
Harriet Smith	patient	encouraging	Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case . 
Harriet Smith	patient	praised	She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.-- 
Harriet Smith	patient	draw	Circumstances that might swell to half an hour 's relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . ) 
Harriet Smith	patient	asking	He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _ her _ .

"" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps .

"" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . "
Harriet Smith	patient	gone	""" She could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go;""--with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma 's feelings : "" Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! "" "
Harriet Smith	patient	imposed	How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under!--The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness . To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour . 
Harriet Smith	patient	persuading	; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter 's becoming known to her-- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it-- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it.-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr. Knightley.-- Every other part of her mind was disgusting . With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body 's feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body 's destiny .

Harriet Smith	patient	proved	She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief . She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on 
Harriet Smith	patient	known	to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly . 
Harriet Smith	patient	flatter	She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _ her _ . 
Harriet Smith	patient	deceived	too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _ her_.--Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage , in fact , would not do for her . 
Harriet Smith	patient	separate	Nothing should separate her from her father . 
Harriet Smith	patient	asked	She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley . 
Harriet Smith	patient	disappointed	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .

Harriet Smith	patient	began	As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them , Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and Harriet . 
Harriet Smith	patient	spare	While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more-- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet 's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children.-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again . 
Harriet Smith	patient	find	CHAPTER XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . 
Harriet Smith	patient	expressed	Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella 's invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss . 
Harriet Smith	patient	have	Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .

Harriet Smith	patient	carrying	The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard 's , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma 's sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself 
Harriet Smith	patient	see	She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill .

Harriet Smith	patient	see	Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman 's language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only in the great.--However 
Harriet Smith	patient	make	, I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _ him _ , and to _ me _ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy . 
Harriet Smith	patient	leave	Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend 's approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--

The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet 's 
Harriet Smith	patient	attended	Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them , 
Harriet Smith	patient	brought	Oh ! had she never brought Harriet forward ! 
Harriet Smith	patient	left	Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong-- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .

Harriet Smith	patient	marrying	How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton 's being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.-- Alas !

Harriet Smith	patient	threatened	CHAPTER XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _ first _ with Mr. Knightley , first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been.--Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella . 
Harriet Smith	patient	loved	She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .

Jane Fairfax	agent	remained	It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn .

Jane Fairfax	agent	reached	This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . 
Jane Fairfax	agent	resolved	She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .

Jane Fairfax	agent	accompanying	With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . 
Jane Fairfax	agent	wished	"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . "" "
Jane Fairfax	agent	injured	It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . 
Jane Fairfax	agent	had	Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance .

Jane Fairfax	agent	relapsing	Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . 
Jane Fairfax	agent	ate	The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again . 
Jane Fairfax	agent	gave	", he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement .

Jane Fairfax	patient	regarded	This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life . These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power . 
Jane Fairfax	patient	brought	The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . 
Jane Fairfax	patient	remind	It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn . 
Jane Fairfax	patient	retained	As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last , had better be soon . 
Jane Fairfax	patient	spared	Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . 
Jane Fairfax	patient	like	"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other .

Jane Fairfax	patient	dislike	In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .

Jane Fairfax	patient	admired	I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body 's performance.--I have been used to hear her 's admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage-- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other .

And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to .

""-- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , "" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible .

Jane Fairfax	patient	induced	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .

Frank Churchill	agent	had	He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character . 
Frank Churchill	patient	see	He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .

Frank Churchill	patient	seeing	I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing . 
Frank Churchill	patient	seeing	"Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before--""You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . "

Frank Churchill	patient	suppose	"What has Mr. Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? "" "" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . "
Frank Churchill	patient	trust	They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . 
Frank Churchill	patient	promised	"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . "" "
Frank Churchill	patient	reckoned	""" Was he handsome?""--""She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . "" "
Frank Churchill	patient	thought	""" Was he agreeable?""-- "" He was generally thought so . "" "
Frank Churchill	patient	used	", he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . "" A very pleasant evening , "" he began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away;--""particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . "
Frank Churchill	patient	presented	The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _ very _ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father 's ; he looked quick and sensible . 
Frank Churchill	patient	like	She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be . 
Frank Churchill	patient	brought	CHAPTER VI The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again . 
Frank Churchill	patient	see	She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend . 
Frank Churchill	patient	see	She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend . 
Frank Churchill	patient	delighted	And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed . 
Frank Churchill	patient	nursed	He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father 's father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards Highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with . 
Frank Churchill	patient	caught	Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . 
Frank Churchill	patient	persuaded	He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body 's returning into their proper place the next morning . 
Frank Churchill	patient	persuaded	"At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it .

CHAPTER VII Emma 's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to London , merely to have his hair cut .

Frank Churchill	patient	called	"His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that "" all young people would have their little whims . "" "
Frank Churchill	patient	left	Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect . 
Frank Churchill	patient	given	This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference-- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance . 
Frank Churchill	patient	judge	Mr. Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly . 
Frank Churchill	patient	seeing	"He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself:-- "" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way .

Frank Churchill	patient	seeing	""" With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time .

Frank Churchill	patient	questioned	He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room-- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could-- that his father , Mr. Knightley , Mr. Cox , and Mr. Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families-- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire-- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and

Frank Churchill	patient	refused	She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring . But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _ refused _ _ him _ .

Frank Churchill	patient	having	This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house .

She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it.-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr. Knightley.-- Every other part of her mind was disgusting .

She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection-- but she had too much to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended with , "" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , "" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .

Philip Elton	patient	take	Neither would Mr. Knightley 's downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _ him _ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable .

Philip Elton	patient	ingratiating	I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you . 
Philip Elton	patient	known	He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . 
Philip Elton	patient	reckoned	He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin 's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton 's admiration .

She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together .

Philip Elton	patient	forgetting	Emma 's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . 
Philip Elton	patient	forgetting	"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . "
Philip Elton	patient	quiet	"She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words "" my son , "" and "" Frank , "" and "" my son , "" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . "
Philip Elton	patient	see	He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--

Philip Elton	patient	marry	But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ) , to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- It was most provoking .

The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _ he _ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .

It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and that there could be no necessity for any body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals , and

She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .

Philip Elton	patient	wished	She wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction . 
Philip Elton	patient	called	Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol-- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained-- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . 
Philip Elton	patient	saw	Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him , or _ just _ to miss him , _ just _ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture .

Philip Elton	patient	talked	The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more . 
Philip Elton	patient	loved	"Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her . She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . "" "
Philip Elton	patient	producing	"Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton . "" "
Philip Elton	patient	acquit	It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it . 
Philip Elton	patient	expected	"The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be .

Philip Elton	patient	thrown	To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . 
Philip Elton	patient	engage	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match . 
Philip Elton	patient	connected	If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set . 
Philip Elton	patient	appealed	"Mr. Elton was appealed to.--""Was not it astonishingly like?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . "" "
Philip Elton	patient	congratulating	"He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates 's good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs. Elton 's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . "" "
Philip Elton	patient	visited	"Do not beat me . "" CHAPTER XVI Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage . "
Philip Elton	patient	expecting	He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . 
Philip Elton	patient	encouraging	When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by 
Philip Elton	patient	join	"kind - hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say , "" Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? "" to which his prompt reply was , "" Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me . "
Philip Elton	patient	excuse	You will excuse me . 
Philip Elton	patient	arranging	She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . 
Philip Elton	patient	thanking	In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again . 
Philip Elton	patient	believed	It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him . 
Philip Elton	patient	called	Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him . 
Philip Elton	patient	telling	And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond .

Philip Elton	patient	greeted	"The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look . Mr. Elton made his appearance . His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity .

Anna Weston	agent	understand	I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . 
Anna Weston	agent	felt	Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .

Anna Weston	patient	thought	Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .

Anna Weston	patient	surprize	You surprize me ! 
Anna Weston	patient	support	"Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley . "" "" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . "" "" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . "
Anna Weston	patient	assure	", I assure you . "" Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston 's on the subject , as much as possible . "
Anna Weston	patient	convinced	"There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma 's destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "" What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? "" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield . CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet 's side , as there could be any occasion for .

Anna Weston	patient	told	""" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . "
Anna Weston	patient	tear	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded . 
Anna Weston	patient	convinced	Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .

She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection-- but she had too much to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended with , "" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , "" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .

Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . "" "" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , "" said Emma , "" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself .

Anna Weston	patient	pity	Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .

Augusta Elton	patient	seen	Mrs. Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet 's going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _ recollecting _ .

Augusta Elton	patient	heard	"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration-- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs. Elton 's knight - errantry on the subject.-- "" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . "

Augusta Elton	patient	loved	And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton 's notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection . 
Augusta Elton	patient	awes	"Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , "" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . "" "" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , "" said Emma . "
Augusta Elton	patient	acknowledging	She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . 
Augusta Elton	patient	including	I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau . 
Augusta Elton	patient	make	Mrs. Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence-- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella 's information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her .

Mr. Weston	agent	believed	"Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! "" "
Mr. Weston	agent	think	"You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill 's account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her-- so they are all to move southward without loss of time . "" "" Indeed!--from Yorkshire , I think . "
Mr. Weston	agent	said	""" The evil of the distance from Enscombe , "" said Mr. Weston , "" is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . "
Mr. Weston	agent	went	It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _ not _ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr. Weston went on .

Mr. Weston	agent	wanted	Tea was carrying round , and Mr. Weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away . 
Mr. Weston	agent	foreseen	It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill 's feelings . 
Mr. Weston	agent	understood	Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends-- for the house was taken for May and June . She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects . 
Mr. Weston	agent	wished	It was the very circumstance he could have wished for . 
Mr. Weston	agent	depended	Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .

Mr. Weston	agent	made	She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man . The whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _ May _ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant .

Mr. Weston	agent	recollect	"Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . "" While she talked of his son , Mr. Weston 's attention was chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away . "
Mr. Weston	agent	said	"It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . "" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? "" said Mr. Weston . "
Mr. Weston	agent	led	and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .

Mr. Weston	patient	think	Some might think him , and others might think her , the most in luck . One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage.--There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction . 
Mr. Weston	patient	introduced	Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . 
Mr. Weston	patient	proved	Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .

Miss Bates	agent	loved	She loved every body , was interested in every body 's happiness , quicksighted to every body 's merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . 
Miss Bates	agent	had	"This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor .

Miss Bates	agent	loved	There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts .

Miss Bates	agent	deserves	yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there .

Miss Bates	patient	questioned	""" Why , to own the truth , "" cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , "" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days .

Miss Bates	patient	pain	Miss Bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her . 
Miss Bates	patient	Pass	Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself . 
Miss Bates	patient	heard	I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome . 
Miss Bates	patient	born	Were she your equal in situation-- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case . She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more . 
Miss Bates	patient	humble	"You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _ some _ , ) would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will,--I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now .

Miss Bates	patient	obliged	Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; 
Miss Bates	patient	seen	Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . 
Miss Bates	patient	questioned	Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . 
Miss Bates	patient	Excuse	"There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , "" This is most kind , indeed!--Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words . "" Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton 's voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .

Miss Bates	patient	recovered.--	Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane 's prospects-- that is , I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.-- 
Miss Bates	patient	distinguishing	"The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look . Mr. Elton made his appearance . His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity . "" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ?

Miss Bates	patient	put	She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . 
Miss Bates	patient	excuse	To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed .

"
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	animated	It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	see	He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	visit	He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	suited	She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	restore	And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	agitated	"I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . "" Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it . "
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	persuaded	In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas . Mr. Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	convince	How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	seated	The misfortune of Harriet 's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of Emma 's being to follow , 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	keep	I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	drank	Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	cheer	Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	revived	To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	prepared	"minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for .

Mr. Woodhouse	patient	admired	She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced .

Mr. Woodhouse	patient	persuaded	Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	assist	Frank 's was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .

Mr. Woodhouse	patient	persuade	He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse , as well as Emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	tempted	Mr. Woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at Donwell , be tempted away to his misery . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	invited	He was invited on good faith . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	upbraid	No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . He did consent . 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	placed	Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves.-- 
Mr. Woodhouse	patient	leave	It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father 's comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family . She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered-- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .

Mr. Woodhouse	patient	induce	He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father 's comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .

Mr. Woodhouse	patient	seeing	They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .

I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .

She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .

She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered-- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .

Isabella Knightley	agent	respected	The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
