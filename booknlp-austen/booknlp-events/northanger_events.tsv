Catherine Morland	agent	say	“ Yes , I know exactly what you will say : Friday , went to the Lower Rooms ; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings — plain black shoes — appeared to much advantage ; but was strangely harassed by a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	tasted	Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner . 
Catherine Morland	agent	cried	“ Oh , dear ! ” cried Catherine , colouring .

Catherine Morland	agent	remember	I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	you surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . 
Catherine Morland	agent	settled	But , my dearest Catherine , have you settled what to wear on your head to - night ?

Catherine Morland	agent	observed	Well , I never observed _ that _ . 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	by the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	” “ I hardly know . 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	I never much thought about it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	think	Something between both , I think . 
Catherine Morland	agent	forgot	I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney—‘a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . ’

Catherine Morland	agent	believe	I believe I have said too much . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	I believe I have said too much . 
Catherine Morland	agent	complied	Catherine , in some amazement , complied , and after remaining a few moments silent , was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world , Laurentina ’s skeleton , when her friend prevented her , by saying , “ For heaven ’s sake ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	Do you know , there are 
Catherine Morland	agent	hope	I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us .

Catherine Morland	agent	uttered	’ Tis James ! ” was uttered at the same moment by Catherine ; and , on catching the young men ’s eyes , the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches , and the servant having now scampered up , the gentlemen jumped out , and the equipage was delivered to his care . 
Catherine Morland	agent	received	Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself .

Catherine Morland	agent	said	He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . ” “ And I am sure , ” said Catherine , “ I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . ” “ Neither one nor t’other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . ” “ That was very good - natured of you , ” said Catherine , quite pleased .

Catherine Morland	agent	find	“ You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	forget	“ Yes , ” said Morland , who overheard this ; “ but you forget that your horse was included . ” “ My horse ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ Thank you , ” said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer . 
Catherine Morland	agent	Shall	“ Shall you indeed ! ” said Catherine very seriously .

Catherine Morland	agent	take	morland must take care of you . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	heard	This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two ; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result . 
Catherine Morland	agent	going	Catherine , humbled and ashamed , was going to apologize for her question , but he prevented her by saying , “ Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t’other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	like	“ I think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , ” said Catherine , with some hesitation , from the fear of mortifying him . 
Catherine Morland	agent	had	“ You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man ’s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	like	Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen ’s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , “ Well , Catherine , how do you like 
Catherine Morland	agent	like	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	say	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you .

Catherine Morland	agent	mentioned	You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	wrote	You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	join	The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated ; and James , who had been engaged quite as long as his sister , was very importunate with Isabella to stand up ; but John was gone into the card - room to speak to a friend , and nothing , she declared , should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too . 
Catherine Morland	agent	accepted	Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude , and they continued as they were for three minutes longer , when Isabella , who had been talking to James on the other side of her , turned again to his sister and whispered , “ My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	had	Catherine had fortitude too ; she suffered , but no murmur passed her lips . 
Catherine Morland	agent	sat	From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister ’s now being by his side ; and therefore , instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen ’s bosom , Catherine sat erect , in the perfect use of her senses , and with cheeks only a little redder than usual . Mr. Tilney and his companion , who continued , though slowly , to approach , were immediately preceded by a lady , an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe ; and this lady stopping to speak to her , they , as belonging to her , stopped likewise , and Catherine , catching Mr. Tilney ’s eye , instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition .

Catherine Morland	agent	found	The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella , who in great spirits exclaimed , “ At last I have got you . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	whispered	“ Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , ” whispered Catherine , detaching her friend from James .

Catherine Morland	agent	had	“ No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ” “ Where can he be ? ” said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . 
Catherine Morland	agent	excused	Again Catherine excused herself ; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself .

Catherine Morland	agent	bear	Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer . 
Catherine Morland	agent	took	Catherine took the advice , and ran off to get ready . 
Catherine Morland	agent	ran	Catherine took the advice , and ran off to get ready .

Catherine Morland	agent	think	Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one , but it was too late to retreat , and she was too young to own herself frightened ; so , resigning herself to her fate , and trusting to the animal ’s boasted knowledge of its owner , she sat peaceably down , and saw Thorpe sit down by her .

Catherine Morland	agent	spoke	Catherine , delighted at so happy an escape , spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise ; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins , and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip .

Catherine Morland	agent	congratulated	Catherine , though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse , he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks , congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman ; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner , without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity , and ( considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour ) by no means alarmingly fast , gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind , in a fine mild day of February , with the consciousness of safety .

Catherine Morland	agent	beheld	It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	cried	“ Good heavens ! ” cried Catherine , quite frightened . 
Catherine Morland	agent	undertake	i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . ” Catherine listened with astonishment ; she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing ; for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle , nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead .

Catherine Morland	agent	found	Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , “ Well , my dear , here you are , ” a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; “ and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	inquired	Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister . 
Catherine Morland	agent	sat	The Allens , Thorpes , and Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre ; and , as Catherine and Isabella sat together , there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them .

Catherine Morland	agent	made	“ Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	took	The female part of the Thorpe family , attended by James Morland , appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour , and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend . James , who was now in constant attendance , maintained a similar position , and separating themselves from the rest of their party , they walked in that manner for some time , till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which , confining her entirely to her friend and brother , gave her very little share in the notice of either .

Catherine Morland	agent	added	“ You can not think , ” added Catherine after a moment ’s silence , “ how surprised I was to see him again . 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	I felt so sure of his being quite gone away . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	think	Do you think her pretty ? ” “ Not very . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	suppose	“ He never comes to the pump - room , I suppose ? ”

Catherine Morland	agent	knew	Catherine knew all this very well ; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before ; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin , and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening

Catherine Morland	agent	satisfied	Catherine satisfied his curiosity . 
Catherine Morland	agent	repeated	“ Tilney , ” he repeated . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	“ Hum — I do not know him . 
Catherine Morland	agent	meet	I had fifty minds to buy it myself , for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one ; but it would not answer my purpose , it would not do for the field . 
Catherine Morland	agent	give	I would give any money for a real good hunter . 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	I have three now , the best that ever were backed . 
Catherine Morland	agent	take	I would not take eight hundred guineas for them . 
Catherine Morland	agent	mean	Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire , against the next season . 
Catherine Morland	agent	perceived	Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set , Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers - on , immediately behind her partner . 
Catherine Morland	agent	guess	But while she did so , the gentleman retreated , and her partner , coming nearer , said , “ I see that you guess what I have just been asked . 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	That gentleman knows your name , and you have a right to know his . 
Catherine Morland	agent	augured	CHAPTER 11 The morrow brought a very sober - looking morning , the sun making only a few efforts to appear , and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes . 
Catherine Morland	agent	sighed	At about eleven o’clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine ’s watchful eye , and “ Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , ” broke from her in a most desponding tone . “ I thought how it would be , ” said Mrs. Allen . “ No walk for me to - day , ” sighed Catherine ; “ but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	mind	that will not signify ; I never mind dirt . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	mind	“ No , ” replied her friend very placidly , “ I know you never mind dirt . ” After a short pause , “ It comes on faster and faster ! ” said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window .

Catherine Morland	agent	take	I would much rather take a chair at any time . ” “ It was such a nice - looking morning ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	i felt so convinced it would be dry ! ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	hope	I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable .

Catherine Morland	agent	went	Catherine went every five minutes to the clock , threatening on each return that , if it still kept on raining another five minutes , she would give up the matter as hopeless . 
Catherine Morland	agent	despair	“ I do not quite despair yet . 
Catherine Morland	agent	give	I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve . 
Catherine Morland	agent	give	There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely . 
Catherine Morland	agent	expect	But whether Catherine might still expect her friends , whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture , must yet be a question . 
Catherine Morland	agent	doubt	“ I doubt our being able to do so much , ” said Morland .

Catherine Morland	agent	saw	Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother ’s arm , walking slowly down the street . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	The others then came close enough for conversation , and Morland said , “ We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I. 
Catherine Morland	agent	suppose	We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ No , he is not , ” said Catherine warmly , “ for I am sure he could not afford it . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	afford	“ And why can not he afford it ? ” “ Because he has not money enough . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	walked	Pondering over these heart - rending tidings , Catherine walked slowly upstairs . 
Catherine Morland	agent	accused	Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered . 
Catherine Morland	agent	offered	Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered .

Catherine Morland	agent	calling	CHAPTER 12 “ Mrs. Allen , ” said Catherine the next morning , “ will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney to - day ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	complied	Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney ’s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen ’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . 
Catherine Morland	agent	left	Catherine , with a blush of mortification , left the house . 
Catherine Morland	agent	believed	She was followed by a gentleman , whom Catherine believed to be her father , and they turned up towards Edgar ’s Buildings . 
Catherine Morland	agent	cried	“ Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , ” cried Catherine , “ because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted .

Catherine Morland	agent	remained	The affair thus determined , and Thorpe ’s approbation secured , Catherine only remained to be apprised of it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	looked	In that interval the plan was completed , and as soon as she came again , her agreement was demanded ; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella , Catherine looked grave , was very sorry , but could not go . 
Catherine Morland	agent	go	I can not go . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart , so sweet a temper , to be so easily persuaded by those she loved . 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	But all in vain ; Catherine felt herself to be in the right , and though pained by such tender , such flattering supplication , could not allow it to influence her . 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind . 
Catherine Morland	agent	help	Isabella , in the meanwhile , had applied her handkerchief to her eyes ; and Morland , miserable at such a sight , could not help saying , “ Nay , Catherine .

Catherine Morland	agent	stand	I think you can not stand out any longer now .

Catherine Morland	agent	withheld	Thorpe would have darted after her , but Morland withheld him . 
Catherine Morland	agent	walked	“ She is as obstinate as — ” Thorpe never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere . 
Catherine Morland	agent	found	Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	had	Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	had	But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing . 
Catherine Morland	agent	proceeded	Catherine , delighted by all that had passed , proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street , walking , as she concluded , with great elasticity , though she had never thought of it before . 
Catherine Morland	agent	cried	“ Dear madam , ” cried Catherine , “ then why did not you tell me so before ?

Catherine Morland	agent	felt	Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed .

Catherine Morland	agent	listened	Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest , wonder , and joy . 
Catherine Morland	agent	did	Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did , in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations .

Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding .

Catherine Morland	agent	hoped	This indulgence , though not more than Catherine had hoped for , completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature , in friends and fortune , circumstance and chance .

Catherine Morland	agent	expressed	Catherine , with all the earnestness of truth , expressed her astonishment at such a charge , protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe ’s being in love with her , and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him . 
Catherine Morland	agent	came	But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	You have both of you something , to be sure , but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays ; and after all that romancers may say 
Catherine Morland	agent	acquit	I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ” “ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ” “ Oh !

Catherine Morland	agent	knew	“ My dearest Catherine , ” continued the other without at all listening to her , “ I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about . 
Catherine Morland	agent	sacrifice	I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant .

CHAPTER 21

Catherine Morland	agent	trembled	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .

Catherine Morland	agent	felt	It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey ; and even then , even in moments of languor or restraint , a sense of general happiness preponderated , and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them . 
Catherine Morland	agent	listened	Catherine , as she crossed the hall , listened to the tempest with sensations of awe ; and , when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door , felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey .

Catherine Morland	agent	walked	They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure . 
Catherine Morland	agent	asked	“ Is it a pretty place ? ” asked Catherine . 
Catherine Morland	agent	hoped	though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter , it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself , under any circumstances , not to be gladly accepted ; for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey , and had seen only a few of its rooms . 
Catherine Morland	agent	promised	The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . “ And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	had	It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General

Catherine Morland	agent	saw	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	understood	Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered . 
Catherine Morland	agent	knew	And nine years , Catherine knew , was a trifle of time , compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife , before her room was put to rights .

Catherine Morland	agent	depended	they were not in every respect answered , for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features , hair , complexion , that should be the very counterpart , the very image , if not of Henry ’s , of Eleanor’s — the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking , bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child . 
Catherine Morland	agent	turning	Again she passed through the folding doors , again her hand was upon the important lock , and Catherine , hardly able to breathe , was turning to close the former with fearful caution , when the figure , the dreaded figure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery , stood before her ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	found	It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike . 
Catherine Morland	agent	expected	Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were . 
Catherine Morland	agent	worked	Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked , and worked they were . 
Catherine Morland	agent	recollected	Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . 
Catherine Morland	agent	blushed	Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ I have been , ” said Catherine , looking down , “ to see your mother ’s room . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ” “ I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	Catherine said nothing . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ But your father , ” said Catherine , “ was _ he _ afflicted ? ” “ For a time , greatly so . 
Catherine Morland	agent	erred	You have erred in supposing him not attached to her . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to — we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition — and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	” “ I am very glad of it , ” said Catherine ; “ it would have been very shocking ! ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	formed	“ If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to — Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained .

Catherine Morland	agent	looked	Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	doubt	Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country , and even of that , if hard pressed , would have yielded the northern and western extremities . 
Catherine Morland	agent	wondered	For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast - room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry ’s willing hand . 
Catherine Morland	agent	hear	You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	hope	You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame ; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned . Thank God ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	give	Dearest Catherine , beware how you give your heart . 
Catherine Morland	agent	read	“ Believe me , ” & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began . 
Catherine Morland	agent	took	Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	you will soon know why . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	declare	“ How quick you are ! ” cried Catherine : “ you have guessed it , I declare ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	heard	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	cried	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “ James only means to give me good advice . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	thinking	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ” ( blushing again that she had blushed before ) ; “ James only means to give me good advice . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	observed	“ But perhaps , ” observed Catherine , “ though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	” “ No , ” said Catherine , after a few moments ’ reflection , “ I do not — ought I ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	ought	” “ No , ” said Catherine , after a few moments ’ reflection , “ I do not — ought I ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	ought	” “ No , ” said Catherine , after a few moments ’ reflection , “ I do not — ought I ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	still	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought 
Catherine Morland	agent	feel	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought 
Catherine Morland	agent	found	Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	found	From this time , the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people ; and Catherine found , with some surprise , that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella ’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother . 
Catherine Morland	agent	look	“ And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ Go away ! ” said Catherine , with a very long face . 
Catherine Morland	agent	trod	It came — it was fine — and Catherine trod on air . 
Catherine Morland	agent	hear	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .

Catherine Morland	agent	thought	A saunter into other meadows , and through part of the village , with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements , and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about , brought them to four o’clock , when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three . 
Catherine Morland	agent	quitted	They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	left	I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath , but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other . 
Catherine Morland	agent	went	Since you went away , I have had no pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything ; and everybody one cares for is gone . 
Catherine Morland	agent	convince	Your kind offices will set all right : he is the only man I ever did or could love , and I trust you will convince him of it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	spend	I hope you spend your time pleasantly , but am afraid you never think of me . 
Catherine Morland	agent	esteem	I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away .

Catherine Morland	agent	stand	“ And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . 
Catherine Morland	agent	explained	Catherine explained : “ Oh ! as to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all . 
Catherine Morland	agent	urge	“ Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther . 
Catherine Morland	agent	do	If you think it long — ” “ Oh ! no , I do not indeed . 
Catherine Morland	agent	stay	For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	walked	Catherine walked on to her chamber , making up her mind as well as she could , to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney , and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her , and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her , that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful . 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent .

Catherine Morland	agent	tell	how shall I tell you ! ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	continuing	After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words . 
Catherine Morland	agent	cried	“ My dear Eleanor , ” cried Catherine , suppressing her feelings as well as she could , “ do not be so distressed . 
Catherine Morland	agent	finish	I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me .

Catherine Morland	agent	received	were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought . 
Catherine Morland	agent	leaving	But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	sat	Catherine sat down , breathless and speechless . 
Catherine Morland	agent	believe	“ I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself — but I must not talk of what I felt .

Catherine Morland	agent	suggest	that I could suggest anything in extenuation ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	driven	after courting you from the protection of real friends to this — almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	seem	dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ Have I offended the General ? ” said Catherine in a faltering voice . 
Catherine Morland	agent	given	for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence . 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	speak	It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all ; and it was only for Eleanor ’s sake that she attempted it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	An engagement , you know , must be kept . 
Catherine Morland	agent	go	Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	taken	Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference . 
Catherine Morland	agent	believe	Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion , but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected , or , at least , not supposed to be connected with it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	loitered	Catherine had not loitered ; she was almost dressed , and her packing almost finished . The possibility of some conciliatory message from the General occurred to her as his daughter appeared . 
Catherine Morland	agent	completing	Very little passed between them on meeting ; each found her greatest safety in silence , and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs , Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress , and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk . 
Catherine Morland	agent	lingering	When everything was done they left the room , Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well - known , cherished object , and went down to the breakfast - parlour , where breakfast was prepared . 
Catherine Morland	agent	write	“ You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ” she cried ; “ you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible . 
Catherine Morland	agent	let	“ You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ” she cried ; “ you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible . 
Catherine Morland	agent	thought	Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment , but , upon examining her purse , was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend , she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home ; and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both , scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together .

Catherine Morland	agent	rising	The carriage was soon announced to be ready ; and Catherine , instantly rising , a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu ; and , as they entered the hall , unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either 
Catherine Morland	agent	sighed	Catherine sighed . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	“ Well , ” continued her philosophic mother , “ I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done . 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets .

Catherine Morland	agent	hoped	Catherine hoped so too , and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment , but her spirits were quite worn down ; and , to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish , she readily agreed to her mother ’s next counsel of going early to bed .

Catherine Morland	agent	coloured	Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , “ No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	took	“ Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ” said she . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , ” said Catherine , her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there . 
Catherine Morland	agent	answer	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	returned	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	reflecting	It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford . CHAPTER 30 Catherine ’s disposition was not naturally sedentary , nor had her habits been ever very industrious ; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort , her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased . 
Catherine Morland	agent	growing	For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint ; but when a third night ’s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness , improved her in useful activity , nor given her a greater inclination for needlework , she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of , “ My dear Catherine , I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady . 
Catherine Morland	agent	try	You have had a long run of amusement , and now you must try to be useful . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	took	Catherine took up her work directly , saying , in a dejected voice , that “ her head did not run upon Bath — much . ” “ Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again .

Catherine Morland	agent	spend	Wherever you are you should always be contented , but especially at home , because there you must spend the most of your time . 
Catherine Morland	agent	talk	I did not quite like , at breakfast , to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger . 
Catherine Morland	agent	care	” “ I am sure I do not care about the bread . 
Catherine Morland	agent	eat	It is all the same to me what I eat . 
Catherine Morland	agent	think	“ There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject , about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance — The Mirror , I think . 
Catherine Morland	agent	look	I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	Catherine said no more , and , with an endeavour to do right , applied to her work ; but , after a few minutes , sunk again , without knowing it herself , into languor and listlessness , moving herself in her chair , from the irritation of weariness , much oftener than she moved her needle .

Catherine Morland	agent	think	Mr. Allen ’s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often . 
Catherine Morland	agent	rejoice	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight . 
Catherine Morland	agent	heard	Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty . 
Catherine Morland	agent	make	“ Catherine would make a sad , heedless young housekeeper to be sure , ” was her mother ’s foreboding remark ; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice . 
Catherine Morland	agent	remained	Henry returned to what was now his only home , to watch over his young plantations , and extend his improvements for her sake , to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward ; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry . 
Catherine Morland	agent	received	Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way . 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation . 
Catherine Morland	agent	had	Here there was something less of crowd than below ; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her , and of all the dangers of her late passage through them . 
Catherine Morland	agent	began	It was a splendid sight , and she began , for the first time that evening , to feel herself at a ball : she longed to dance , but she had not an acquaintance in the room .

Catherine Morland	agent	felt	when at last arrived in the tea - room , she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join , no acquaintance to claim , no gentleman to assist them . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ It would have been very shocking to have it torn , ” said she , “ would not it ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	seen	For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room , I assure you . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	get	“ But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak . 
Catherine Morland	agent	remonstrated	Morland remonstrated , pleaded the authority of road - books , innkeepers , and milestones ; but his friend disregarded them all ; he had a surer test of distance . 
Catherine Morland	agent	lost	It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . ” “ You have lost an hour , ” said Morland ; “ it was only ten o’clock when we came from Tetbury . ” “ Ten o’clock !

Catherine Morland	agent	see	This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	think	What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	guess	“ I am sure I can not guess at all . ” “ Curricle - hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better . 
Catherine Morland	agent	said	“ Yes , ” said Morland , who overheard this ; “ but you forget that your horse was included . ” “ My horse ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	“ Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	returned	The young ladies were introduced to each other , Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness , Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation ; and Mrs. Hughes , satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge , returned to her party . 
Catherine Morland	agent	do	How do you do , Mrs. Allen ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	mean	“ What do you mean ? ” said Catherine . 
Catherine Morland	agent	forgot	Why , you have not forgot our engagement ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	What a head you have ! 
Catherine Morland	agent	know	they are coming for me perhaps — but I shall not go — I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	talking	Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy - six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern — do you understand ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	think	“ And now , Henry , ” said Miss Tilney , “ that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself — unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . 
Catherine Morland	agent	acquainted	” “ I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	hear	Did you ever hear the old song , ‘ Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? ’ 
Catherine Morland	agent	come	I say , you will come to Belle ’s wedding , I hope . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	know”—twisting	“ Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . ” “ And then you know”—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh—“I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . ” “ May we ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	forcing	“ Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . ” “ And then you know”—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh—“I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . ” “ May we ?

Catherine Morland	agent	have	But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe . 
Catherine Morland	agent	have	A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and 
Catherine Morland	agent	say	And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . 
Catherine Morland	agent	think	But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters . 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	Catherine ’s spirits revived as they drove from the door ; for with Miss Tilney she felt 
Catherine Morland	agent	caught	, with the interest of a road entirely new to her , of an abbey before , and a curricle behind , she caught the last view of Bath without any regret , and met with every milestone before she expected it .

Catherine Morland	agent	began	He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “ I am particularly fond of this spot , ” said her companion , with a sigh . 
Catherine Morland	agent	waited	Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before , and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance , and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more . 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	“ I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	stopped	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	added	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”

Catherine Morland	agent	doubted	From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present .

Catherine Morland	agent	read	how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about — from abbeys and castles , in which , though certainly larger than Northanger , all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost . 
Catherine Morland	agent	began	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	She felt the unexpected compliment , and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself , and so full of civility to all her family . 
Catherine Morland	agent	suppose	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ? 
Catherine Morland	agent	paced	Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest . 
Catherine Morland	agent	ventured	She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour .

Catherine Morland	agent	inform	Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney ’s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen ’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . 
Catherine Morland	agent	believed	Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney ’s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen ’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . 
Catherine Morland	agent	had	To Milsom Street she was directed , and having made herself perfect in the number , hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit , explain her conduct , and be forgiven ; tripping lightly through the church - yard , and resolutely turning away her eyes , that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family , who , she had reason to believe , were in a shop hard by . 
Catherine Morland	agent	reached	She reached the house without any impediment , looked at the number , knocked at the door , and inquired for Miss Tilney . 
Catherine Morland	agent	looked	She reached the house without any impediment , looked at the number , knocked at the door , and inquired for Miss Tilney . 
Catherine Morland	agent	gave	She gave her card . 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _ was _ at home , and too much offended to admit her ; and as she retired down the street , could not withhold one glance at the drawing - room windows , in expectation of seeing her there , but no one appeared at them . 
Catherine Morland	agent	retired	She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _ was _ at home , and too much offended to admit her ; and as she retired down the street , could not withhold one glance at the drawing - room windows , in expectation of seeing her there , but no one appeared at them . 
Catherine Morland	agent	looked	At the bottom of the street , however , she looked back again , and then , not at a window , but 
Catherine Morland	agent	saw	issuing from the door , she saw Miss Tilney herself . 
Catherine Morland	agent	checked	She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility ; but she checked the resentful sensation ; she remembered her own ignorance . 
Catherine Morland	agent	knew	She knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness , to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead , nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable . 
Catherine Morland	agent	had	Dejected and humbled , she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night ; but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance , for she soon recollected , in the first place , that she was without any excuse for staying at home ; and , in the second , that it was a play she wanted very much to see .

Catherine Morland	agent	feared	To the theatre accordingly they all went ; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her ; she feared that , amongst the many perfections of the family , a fondness for plays was not to be ranked ; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage , which she knew , on Isabella ’s authority , rendered everything else of the kind “ quite horrid . ” 
Catherine Morland	agent	had	She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure ; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one , observing her during the first four acts , would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her . 
Catherine Morland	agent	watch	Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box ; and , for the space of two entire scenes , did she thus watch Henry Tilney , without being once able to catch his eye . No longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play ; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes . 
Catherine Morland	agent	took	Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her ; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation — instead of proudly resolving , in conscious innocence , to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it , to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation , and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight , or flirting with somebody else — she took to herself all the shame of misconduct , or at least of its appearance , and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause . The play concluded — the curtain fell — Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat , but his father remained , and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box .

Catherine Morland	agent	quitting	Her happiness in going with Miss Tilney , however , prevented their wishing it otherwise ; and , as they were to remain only one more week in Bath themselves , her quitting them now would not long be felt . 
Catherine Morland	agent	wished	that , in the embarrassment of the first five minutes , she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney Street . 
Catherine Morland	agent	doubted	Nay , perverse as it seemed , she doubted whether she might not have felt less , had she been less attended to . 
Catherine Morland	agent	eat	His anxiety for her comfort — his continual solicitations that she would eat , and his often - expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste — though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast - table — made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor .

Catherine Morland	agent	knew	She felt utterly unworthy of such respect , and knew not how to reply to it . 
Catherine Morland	agent	found	She was quite pained by the severity of his father ’s reproof , which seemed disproportionate to the offence ; and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture , and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her . 
Catherine Morland	agent	felt	This was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation , and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney , without being able to hope for his goodwill . 
Catherine Morland	agent	hoped	It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “ How glad I shall be when you are all off .

Catherine Morland	patient	seen	﻿ [ Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen ( 1803 ) ] CHAPTER 1 No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine . 
Catherine Morland	patient	born	She had three sons before Catherine was born ; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world , as anybody might expect , she still lived on — lived to have six children more — to see them growing up around her , and to enjoy excellent health herself . 
Catherine Morland	patient	wrap	“ I beg , Catherine , you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat , when you come from the Rooms at night ; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend ; I will give you this little book on purpose . 
Catherine Morland	patient	reduce	It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen , that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work , and how she will , probably , contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable — whether by her imprudence , vulgarity , or jealousy — whether by intercepting her letters , ruining her character , or turning her out of doors . 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	“ Indeed I shall say no such thing . ” “ Shall I tell you what you ought to say ? ” “ If you please . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	told	“ That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	“ That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	authorized	“ Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much . 
Catherine Morland	patient	engaged	Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain . 
Catherine Morland	patient	surprise	you surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . 
Catherine Morland	patient	determined	I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	ask	by the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . 
Catherine Morland	patient	betray	You must not betray me , if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description . 
Catherine Morland	patient	Betray	“ Betray you ! 
Catherine Morland	patient	distress	what do you mean ? ” “ Nay , do not distress me . 
Catherine Morland	patient	assure	“ But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . ” “ I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	informed	Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself . 
Catherine Morland	patient	drive	“ I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	Thank	“ Thank you , ” said Catherine , in some distress , from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer . 
Catherine Morland	patient	drive	“ I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	Thank	“ Thank you ; but will not your horse want rest ? ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	drive	“ Forty ! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	envy	My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , 
Catherine Morland	patient	assure	“ You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man ’s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	please	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening . 
Catherine Morland	patient	see	“ Because I thought I should soon see you myself . 
Catherine Morland	patient	assure	“ I assure you , ” said she , “ I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world ; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	asked	This was accordingly done , Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them ; and after a few minutes ’ consideration , he asked Catherine to dance with him . 
Catherine Morland	patient	got	The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella , who in great spirits exclaimed , “ At last I have got you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	induce	What could induce you to come into this set , when you knew I was in the other ? 
Catherine Morland	patient	satisfy	“ And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? ” “ Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	shock	Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? 
Catherine Morland	patient	ask	“ He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ” “ Where can he be ? ” said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . 
Catherine Morland	patient	asked	he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , ” said Mrs. Allen ; 
Catherine Morland	patient	excused	Again Catherine excused herself ; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself . 
Catherine Morland	patient	inform	At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , “ Well , Miss Morland , here I am . 
Catherine Morland	patient	left	This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply , of which no part was very distinct , except the frequent exclamations , amounting almost to oaths , which adorned it , and Catherine was left , when it ended , with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford , and the same happy conviction of her brother ’s comparative sobriety . 
Catherine Morland	patient	bound	I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	bless	Lord bless you ! 
Catherine Morland	patient	got	my beloved Catherine , have I got you at last ? ” was her address on Catherine ’s entering the box and sitting by her . 
Catherine Morland	patient	entered	“ Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	seeing	“ When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before , he was in Bath but for a couple of days . 
Catherine Morland	patient	seeing	“ I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon , ” said Catherine . 
Catherine Morland	patient	have	What chap have you there ? ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	satisfied	Catherine satisfied his curiosity . 
Catherine Morland	patient	weary	It is so d — — uncomfortable , living at an inn . ” This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine ’s attention , for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies . 
Catherine Morland	patient	regarded	Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set , Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers - on , immediately behind her partner . 
Catherine Morland	patient	thank	You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme ; it darted into our heads at breakfast - time , I verily believe at the same instant ; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for 
Catherine Morland	patient	obliged	But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit . 
Catherine Morland	patient	come	At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . 
Catherine Morland	patient	see	“ Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , ” cried Catherine , “ because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted . 
Catherine Morland	patient	hurt	“ Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , ” cried Catherine , “ because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted .

Catherine Morland	patient	see	“ I was not within at the time ; but I heard of it from Eleanor , and she has been wishing ever since to see you , to explain the reason of such incivility ; but perhaps I can do it as well . 
Catherine Morland	patient	assure	That was all , I do assure you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	urge	“ Do not urge me , Isabella . 
Catherine Morland	patient	engaged	I am engaged to Miss Tilney . 
Catherine Morland	patient	love	“ I can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively ! 
Catherine Morland	patient	Thank	“ Thank ye , ” cried Thorpe , “ but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool . 
Catherine Morland	patient	driving	I only go for the sake of driving you . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	acquitted	all our distresses are over ; you are honourably acquitted , and we shall have 
Catherine Morland	patient	persuaded	If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong , I never will be tricked into it . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	tricked	If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong , I never will be tricked into it . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	“ Dear madam , ” cried Catherine , “ then why did not you tell me so before ? 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	puts	It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through , in The Mysteries of Udolpho . 
Catherine Morland	patient	establish	I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	tells	I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . 
Catherine Morland	patient	weary	I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . 
Catherine Morland	patient	delights	— the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . ” “ Historians , you think , ” said Miss Tilney , “ are not happy in their flights of fancy . 
Catherine Morland	patient	struck	If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person ’s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . ” “ That little boys and girls should be tormented , ” said Henry , “ is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb ‘ to torment , ’ as I observed to be your own method , instead of ‘ to instruct , ’ supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . ” “ You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . ” “ Very probably . 
Catherine Morland	patient	assure	But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	hastened	CHAPTER 15 Early the next day , a note from Isabella , speaking peace and tenderness in every line , and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance , hastened Catherine , in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity , to Edgar ’s Buildings . 
Catherine Morland	patient	embracing	Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : “ Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	deceived	Maria was without ceremony sent away , and Isabella , embracing Catherine , thus began : “ Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	saw	“ You are so like your dear brother , ” continued Isabella , “ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . 
Catherine Morland	patient	beheld	The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas — the very first moment I beheld him — my heart was irrecoverably gone . 
Catherine Morland	patient	pain	i am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it . 
Catherine Morland	patient	assure	“ You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	hurt	Catherine was hurt by these insinuations . 
Catherine Morland	patient	wound	these were thrilling words , and wound up Catherine ’s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy . 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	“ But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? ” “ Oh yes , and so I have . 
Catherine Morland	patient	tease	“ I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ” “ Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further . 
Catherine Morland	patient	convinced	I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ” “ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ” “ Oh ! 
Catherine Morland	patient	assured	But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . 
Catherine Morland	patient	judge	But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . 
Catherine Morland	patient	hurrying	“ My dearest Catherine , ” continued the other without at all listening to her , “ I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about . 
Catherine Morland	patient	sacrifice	I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant . 
Catherine Morland	patient	pleases	I hope this pleases you ” ( turning her back on him ) ; “ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	told	Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . 
Catherine Morland	patient	expected	“ But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	assure	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ” “ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	thank	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? 
Catherine Morland	patient	recollecting	Catherine , recollecting herself , grew ashamed of her eagerness , and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related . 
Catherine Morland	patient	satisfy	A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of . 
Catherine Morland	patient	roused	Hour after hour passed away , and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep . CHAPTER 22 The housemaid ’s folding back her window - shutters at eight o’clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine ; and she opened her eyes , wondering that they could ever have been closed , on objects of cheerfulness ; her fire was already burning , and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night . 
Catherine Morland	patient	saved	Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the General , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind , but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure . 
Catherine Morland	patient	attend	The netting - box , just leisurely drawn forth , was closed with joyful haste , and she was ready to attend him in a moment . “ And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	kept	It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs ; and Catherine , struck by its gloomy aspect , and eager to enter it , could not , even by the General ’s disapprobation , be kept from stepping forward . 
Catherine Morland	patient	shocked	He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “ I am particularly fond of this spot , ” said her companion , with a sigh . 
Catherine Morland	patient	show	Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ” Here was another proof . 
Catherine Morland	patient	struck	This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable . 
Catherine Morland	patient	impressed	They took a slight survey of all ; and Catherine was impressed , beyond her expectation , by their multiplicity and their convenience . 
Catherine Morland	patient	take	what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine . 
Catherine Morland	patient	win	” But neither the business alleged , nor the magnificent compliment , could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose . 
Catherine Morland	patient	found	It was done ; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike . 
Catherine Morland	patient	recollected	Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . 
Catherine Morland	patient	understand	“ If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to — Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained . 
Catherine Morland	patient	awakened	Catherine was completely awakened . 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	She opened it ; it was from Oxford ; and to this purpose : “ Dear Catherine , “ Though , God knows , with little inclination for writing , I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me . 
Catherine Morland	patient	pain	I shall not enter into particulars — they would only pain you more . 
Catherine Morland	patient	Believe	“ Believe me , ” & c. Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance , and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder , declared her to be receiving unpleasant news ; and Henry , earnestly watching her through the whole letter , saw plainly that it ended no better than it began . 
Catherine Morland	patient	thank	“ No , I thank you ” ( sighing as she spoke ) ; “ they are all very well . 
Catherine Morland	patient	hurt	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought 
Catherine Morland	patient	see	I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive . 
Catherine Morland	patient	set	I will not say all that I could of the family you are with , because I would not be ungenerous , or set you against those you esteem ; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust , and young men never know their minds two days together . 
Catherine Morland	patient	stand	“ And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . 
Catherine Morland	patient	complimented	But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . ” Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness . 
Catherine Morland	patient	distracts	This kindness distracts me — I can not bear it — I come to you on such an errand ! ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	“ How shall I tell you ! 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	how shall I tell you ! ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	tell	After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words . 
Catherine Morland	patient	offended	I am very , very sorry we are to part — so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . 
Catherine Morland	patient	finish	I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me . 
Catherine Morland	patient	offered	But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	courting	after courting you from the protection of real friends to this — almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! 
Catherine Morland	patient	acquit	dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	take	Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	see	Eleanor saw that she wished to be alone ; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation , now left her with , “ I shall see you in 
Catherine Morland	patient	provided	It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home , Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey , and , upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation , it proved to be exactly the case . 
Catherine Morland	patient	distinguished	Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine ! 
Catherine Morland	patient	wishing	“ I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , ” said Sarah , “ but why not do it civilly ? ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	forced	It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . 
Catherine Morland	patient	reproach	As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure . 
Catherine Morland	patient	marrying	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them . 
Catherine Morland	patient	treated	Henry ’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated , on comprehending his father ’s views , and being ordered to acquiesce in them , had been open and bold . 
Catherine Morland	patient	beloved	CHAPTER 31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start . 
Catherine Morland	patient	married	The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting 
Catherine Morland	patient	feel	It was a splendid sight , and she began , for the first time that evening , to feel herself at a ball : she longed to dance , but she had not an acquaintance in the room . 
Catherine Morland	patient	told	“ I am quite of your opinion , sir , ” replied Mrs. Allen ; “ and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	introduced	The Miss Thorpes were introduced ; and Miss Morland , who had been for a short time forgotten , was introduced likewise . 
Catherine Morland	patient	accompany	attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump - room , but required , when they all quitted it together , that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen ’s house ; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands , after learning , to their mutual relief , that they should see each other across the theatre at night , and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning . 
Catherine Morland	patient	Tell	Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	see	My father and mother will be very glad to see you . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	handed	The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out , though there were three people to go in it , and his daughter ’s maid had so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit ; and , so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in , that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing - desk from being thrown out into the street . 
Catherine Morland	patient	leading	but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on . 
Catherine Morland	patient	strike	The number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices . 
Catherine Morland	patient	amazed	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . 
Catherine Morland	patient	shown	She was here shown successively into three large bed - chambers , with their dressing - rooms , most completely and handsomely fitted up ; everything that money and taste could do , to give comfort and elegance to apartments , had been bestowed on these ; and , being furnished within the last five years , they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing , and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine . 
Catherine Morland	patient	called	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ? 
Catherine Morland	patient	allowed	Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest . 
Catherine Morland	patient	mislead	Something was certainly to be concealed ; her fancy , though it had trespassed lately once or twice , could not mislead her here ; and 
Catherine Morland	patient	attend	She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour . 
Catherine Morland	patient	understood	Catherine understood her : the General must be watched from home , before that room could be entered . 
Catherine Morland	patient	disgust	He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day ’s society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood . 
Catherine Morland	patient	treating	Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness . 
Catherine Morland	patient	attach	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error . 
Catherine Morland	patient	dismiss	” And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch , which is the true heroine ’s portion ; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears . 
Catherine Morland	patient	inform	Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney ’s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen ’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . 
Catherine Morland	patient	directed	To Milsom Street she was directed , and having made herself perfect in the number , hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit , explain her conduct , and be forgiven ; tripping lightly through the church - yard , and resolutely turning away her eyes , that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family , who , she had reason to believe , were in a shop hard by . 
Catherine Morland	patient	explain	To Milsom Street she was directed , and having made herself perfect in the number , hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit , explain her conduct , and be forgiven ; tripping lightly through the church - yard , and resolutely turning away her eyes , that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family , who , she had reason to believe , were in a shop hard by .

Catherine Morland	patient	gave	She gave her card . 
Catherine Morland	patient	admit	She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _ was _ at home , and too much offended to admit her ; and as she retired down the street , could not withhold one glance at the drawing - room windows , in expectation of seeing her there , but no one appeared at them . 
Catherine Morland	patient	seeing	She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _ was _ at home , and too much offended to admit her ; and as she retired down the street , could not withhold one glance at the drawing - room windows , in expectation of seeing her there , but no one appeared at them . 
Catherine Morland	patient	followed	She was followed by a gentleman , whom Catherine believed to be her father , and they turned up towards Edgar ’s Buildings . 
Catherine Morland	patient	please	To the theatre accordingly they all went ; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her ; she feared that , amongst the many perfections of the family , a fondness for plays was not to be ranked ; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage , which she knew , on Isabella ’s authority , rendered everything else of the kind “ quite horrid . ” 
Catherine Morland	patient	deceived	She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure ; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one , observing her during the first four acts , would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her . 
Catherine Morland	patient	recalled	On the beginning of the fifth , however , the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father , joining a party in the opposite box , recalled her to anxiety and distress . 
Catherine Morland	patient	hear	Catherine was restlessly miserable ; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation . 
Catherine Morland	patient	possessed	Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her ; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation — instead of proudly resolving , in conscious innocence , to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it , to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation , and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight , or flirting with somebody else — she took to herself all the shame of misconduct , or at least of its appearance , and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause . The play concluded — the curtain fell — Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat , but his father remained , and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box . 
Catherine Morland	patient	bring	But my affair is widely different ; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace ; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness . 
Catherine Morland	patient	involved	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give . 
Catherine Morland	patient	lose	CHAPTER 20 Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend , whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion , and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased . 
Catherine Morland	patient	attended	Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion , 
Catherine Morland	patient	finding	Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion , 
Catherine Morland	patient	reassure	Miss Tilney ’s manners and Henry ’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings ; but still she was far from being at ease ; nor could the incessant attentions of the General himself entirely reassure her . 
Catherine Morland	patient	attended	Nay , perverse as it seemed , she doubted whether she might not have felt less , had she been less attended to . 
Catherine Morland	patient	placing	This was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation , and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney , without being able to hope for his goodwill . 
Catherine Morland	patient	confirmed	He listened to his father in silence , and attempted not any defence , which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind , on Isabella ’s account , might , by keeping him long sleepless , have been the real cause of his rising late . 
Catherine Morland	patient	form	It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “ How glad I shall be when you are all off . 
Catherine Morland	patient	addressed	After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with—“I have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you like the place altogether . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	tasted	Here Catherine and Isabella , arm in arm , again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation ; they talked much , and with much enjoyment ; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	liked	She liked him the better for being a clergyman , “ for she must confess herself very partial to the profession ” ; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	had	Catherine , though a little disappointed , had too much good nature to make any opposition , and the others rising up , Isabella had only time to press her friend ’s hand and say , “ Good - bye , my dear love , ” before they hurried off . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	cried	“ There , ” cried Isabella , “ you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	going	Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	called	“ My dearest creature , ” cried Isabella , to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage , “ you have been at least three hours getting ready .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	addressed	But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	rose	And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	know	I know it will be the death of me . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	spoke	A reverie succeeded this conviction — and when Isabella spoke again , it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding - gown . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	became	Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	called	The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella ’s features , all care and anxiety seemed removed , her spirits became almost too high for control , and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	knew	She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	took	She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	saw	She saw herself at the end of a few weeks , the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton , the envy of every valued old friend in Putney , with a carriage at her command , a new name on her tickets , and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger . When the contents of the letter were ascertained , John Thorpe , who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London , prepared to set off . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	gave	Isabella , on hearing the particulars of the visit , gave a different explanation : “ It was all pride , pride , insufferable haughtiness and pride ! 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	say	“ I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	seem	“ I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	entreat	Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	suppose	i do not suppose he ever thinks of me . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	say	“ That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	believe	i really believe John has the most constant heart . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	assure	“ But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	know	i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	suspect	i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	believe	I believe he is a very gentleman - like man . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	see	John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ” “ Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	go	“ And must I go ? ” “ Do not you intend it ?

Isabella Thorpe	agent	refuse	“ Nay , since you make such a point of it , I can refuse you nothing . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	know	But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	credit	” Isabella ’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend ; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister ; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	looked	She looked at him with great admiration , and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother , though , in her eyes , his air was more assuming , and his countenance less prepossessing .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	have	They retired whispering together ; and , though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm , and lay it down as fact , that Captain Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her , which he now hastened to communicate to his brother , in the hope of separating them forever , she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	beginning	Her suspense was of full five minutes ’ duration ; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour , when they both returned , and an explanation was given , by Henry ’s requesting to know , if she thought her friend , Miss Thorpe , would have any objection to dancing , as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	desire	Do you really desire it ? 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	preparing	There was a something , however , in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion ; and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time , forgetting to speak or to listen , and almost forgetting where she was ; till , roused by the voice of Isabella , she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	shrugged	Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled , the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given ; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine ’s comprehension , she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	explained	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death .

He is such a rattle ! 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	refused	I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	begged	I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	told	i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace

Isabella Thorpe	agent	suppose	yes , I suppose he may . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	dare	I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	know	You know he is over head and ears in love with you . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	gave	And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	know	I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind , you know ! 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	did	“ But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ”

Isabella Thorpe	agent	distinguish	Though spoken low , she could distinguish , “ What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! ” “ Psha , nonsense ! ” was Isabella ’s answer in the same half whisper .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	leave	With much uneasiness did she thus leave them . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	encouraging	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	mean	am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	fretted	She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	matched	She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on , and how the rooms were attended ; and especially was she anxious to be assured of Isabella ’s having matched some fine netting - cotton , on which she had left her intent ; and of her continuing on the best terms with James . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	got	James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	marrying	From this time , the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people ; and Catherine found , with some surprise , that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella ’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	suffered	They were so fully convinced , however , that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father ’s consent , and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time , that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	examined	They will hardly follow us there . ” Away they walked to the book ; and while Isabella examined the names , it was Catherine ’s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men . “ They are not coming this way , are they ? 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	said	“ And which way are they gone ? ” said Isabella , turning hastily round . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	added	“ Only , ” she added , “ perhaps we may overtake the two young men . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	lamented	This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing - looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	said	“ Oh , these odious gigs ! ” said Isabella , looking up . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	detest	“ How I detest them . ”

Isabella Thorpe	agent	do	Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	think	He took out his watch : “ How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? ” 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	led	James and Isabella led the way ; and so well 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	cried	“ How delightful that will be ! ” cried Isabella , turning round . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	envy	My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	assuring	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening . 
Isabella Thorpe	agent	has	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you .

Isabella Thorpe	agent	seeing	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ?

Isabella Thorpe	patient	find	Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude , and they continued as they were for three minutes longer , when Isabella , who had been talking to James on the other side of her , turned again to his sister and whispered , “ My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	please	and she would neither believe her own watch , nor her brother ’s , nor the servant ’s ; she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality , till Morland produced his watch , and ascertained the fact ; to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ , would have been equally inconceivable , incredible , and impossible ; and she could only protest , over and over again , that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before , as Catherine was called on to confirm ; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella ; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend ’s dissenting voice , by not waiting for her answer . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	took	The female part of the Thorpe family , attended by James Morland , appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour , and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend . James , who was now in constant attendance , maintained a similar position , and separating themselves from the rest of their party , they walked in that manner for some time , till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which , confining her entirely to her friend and brother , gave her very little share in the notice of either .

Isabella Thorpe	patient	empowered	At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend , by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney , whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs. Hughes , and whom she instantly joined , with a firmer determination to be acquainted , than she might have had courage to command , had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before .

Isabella Thorpe	patient	joining	To escape , and , as she believed , so narrowly escape John Thorpe , and to be asked , so immediately on his joining her , asked by Mr. Tilney , as if he had sought her on purpose!—it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity .

Isabella Thorpe	patient	engaged	i only came for the sake of dancing with _ you _ , and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	asked	Yes ; I remember , I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	go	“ I can not go , because”—looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella ’s smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	accused	Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows , so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind , and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	addressing	But Isabella became only more and more urgent , calling on her in the most affectionate manner , addressing her by the most endearing names . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	reproached	She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney , though she had known her so little a while , than for her best and oldest friends , with being grown cold and indifferent , in short , towards herself .

Isabella Thorpe	patient	crossed	These painful ideas crossed her mind , though she said nothing . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	Left	Left her this moment . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	Told	Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to - morrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday .

Isabella Thorpe	patient	set	I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	caught	Isabella , however , caught hold of one hand , Thorpe of the other , and remonstrances poured in from all three . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	suit	When everything was settled , when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well , it was quite ridiculous , quite absurd , to make any further objection . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	told	Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys ; they were turning the corner into Brock Street , when he had overtaken them , and were at home by this time . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	permit	“ She is as obstinate as — ” Thorpe never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	found	Then , opening the first door before her , which happened to be the right , she immediately found herself in the drawing - room with General Tilney , his son , and daughter . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	exceeded	But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	addressed	But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment , Catherine , though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication , had no means of knowing . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	introduced	The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	reduced	To such anxious attention was the General ’s civility carried , that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house , he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	asking	And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity . After sitting with them a quarter of an hour , she rose to take leave , and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney ’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	expect	Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	spare	The General declared he could say no more ; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded ; but on some other day he trusted , when longer notice could be given , they would not refuse to spare her to her friend . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	attended	The General attended her himself to the street - door , saying everything gallant as they went downstairs , admiring the elasticity of her walk , which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing , and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld , when they parted . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	spared	A sacrifice was always noble ; and if she had given way to their entreaties , she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased , a brother angry , and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed , perhaps through her means . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	engaged	“ No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	told	“ No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	splashed	You are splashed getting in and getting out ; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	discouraged	Mr. Allen , however , discouraged her from doing any such thing . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	leave	“ You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her .

Isabella Thorpe	patient	support	With Mr. Allen to support her , she felt no dread of the event : but she would gladly be spared a contest , where victory itself was painful , and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them .

Isabella Thorpe	patient	allow	Catherine was still unconvinced ; but glad that Anne should have the friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her , she bade her adieu without much uneasiness , and returned home , pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it , and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to resent her resistance any longer . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	persuade	Catherine endeavoured to persuade her , as she was herself persuaded , that her father and mother would never oppose their son ’s wishes . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	worked	Catherine was with her friend again the next day , endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters ; a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near , Isabella became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived , had worked herself into a state of real distress . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	called	The brightest glow was instantly spread over Isabella ’s features , all care and anxiety seemed removed , her spirits became almost too high for control , and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	saw	She saw herself at the end of a few weeks , the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at Fullerton , the envy of every valued old friend in Putney , with a carriage at her command , a new name on her tickets , and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger . When the contents of the letter were ascertained , John Thorpe , who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to London , prepared to set off . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	finding	“ Well , Miss Morland , ” said he , on finding her alone in the parlour , “ I am come to bid you good - bye . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	hear	Without appearing to hear her , he walked to the window , fidgeted about , hummed a tune , and seemed wholly self - occupied . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	entreat	Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	assure	“ But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	plague	Charles Hodges will plague me to death , I dare say ; but I shall cut him very short . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	met	The evening rewarded her confidence ; she was met by one with the same kindness , and by the other with the same attention , as heretofore : 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	asked	Miss Tilney took pains to be near her , and Henry asked her to dance . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	give	Henry smiled , and said , “ How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people ’s actions . ” “ Why ? 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	understand	“ I do not understand you . ” “ Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	understand	“ I do not understand you . ” “ Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ”

Isabella Thorpe	patient	ask	after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ” “ I can not take surprise to myself on that head . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	explained	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle ! 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	fatigued	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over ; but then , as they walked about the room arm in arm , Isabella thus explained herself : “ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle ! 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	pressed	You have no idea how he pressed me . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	excuse	I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	congratulated	Catherine , whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father ’s income , and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother , felt equally well satisfied , and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	recollected	Isabella recollected herself . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	know	“ As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	satisfy	“ As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	found	my Catherine , you have found me out . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	love	We perfectly understand the present vexation ; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	seeing	With a mind thus full of happiness , Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away , without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	write	What can he write about , but yourself ? 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	convinced	However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	determined	Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John — is not it so ? ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	acquit	I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ” “ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ” “ Oh !

Isabella Thorpe	patient	excuse	so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her , and must sit quietly down again . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	joined	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	put	catherine longed to give her a hint of it , to put her on her guard , and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	convinced	She was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere ; for she had not forgotten that he could mistake , and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	watching	CHAPTER 19 A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	saw	But when Catherine saw her in public , admitting Captain Tilney ’s attentions as readily as they were offered , and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles , the alteration became too positive to be passed over . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	please	Though his looks did not please her , his name was a passport to her goodwill , and she thought with sincere compassion of 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	remind	She wished , by a gentle remonstrance , to remind Isabella of her situation , and make her aware of this double unkindness ; but for remonstrance , either opportunity or comprehension was always against her . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	fretted	She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	attached	You know she must be attached to him . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	drink	The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	losing	You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	love	To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought

Isabella Thorpe	patient	turned	Their persuasion that the General would , upon this ground alone , independent of the objection that might be raised against her character , oppose the connection , turned her 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	given	The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money , 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	tempted	which she had more than once heard him utter , and which tempted her to think

Isabella Thorpe	patient	loved	She was ashamed of Isabella , and ashamed of having ever loved her . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	engaging	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	give	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	legacied	Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter ; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	thrown	In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies !

Isabella Thorpe	patient	persuade	“ But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . ” “ Not see him again ! 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	assured	In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	rid	“ Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	fated	This evil had been felt and lamented , at least three times a day , by Isabella since her residence in Bath ; and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more , for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage , and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds , and threading the gutters of that interesting alley , they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig , driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing - looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself , his companion , and his horse . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	received	Catherine , by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected , received her brother with the liveliest pleasure ; and he , being of a very amiable disposition , and sincerely attached to her , gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction , which he could have leisure to do , while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice ; and to her his devoirs were speedily paid , with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine , had she been more expert in the development of other people ’s feelings , and less simply engrossed by her own , that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	told	Her brother told her that it was twenty - three miles . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	know	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	love	“ Indeed I am , ” she replied ; “ I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	like	“ Indeed I am , ” she replied ; “ I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	admired	how fond all the family are of her ; she is evidently the general favourite ; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this — is not she ? ” 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	driving	At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running upstairs , calling out , “ Well , Miss Morland , here I am . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	overtook	Towards the end of the morning , however , Catherine , having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment ’s delay , walked out into the town , and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she was loitering towards Edgar ’s Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world , who had been her dear friends all the morning . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	left	I left her and Bath yesterday , never to see either again . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	marrying	His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	marrying	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer . 
Isabella Thorpe	patient	has	He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . 
Henry Tilney	agent	guessed	“ That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , ” said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	“ That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , ” said Mr. Tilney , looking at the muslin . 
Henry Tilney	agent	heard	I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	indulged	Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	“ What are you thinking of so earnestly ? ” said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; “ not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	hope	“ What are you thinking of so earnestly ? ” said he , as they walked back to the ballroom ; “ not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	tell	“ That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	appear	CHAPTER 4 With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump - room the next day , secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over , and ready to meet him with a smile ; but no smile was demanded — Mr. Tilney did not appear . 
Henry Tilney	agent	seemed	From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance .

Henry Tilney	agent	looked	He looked as handsome and as lively as ever , and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing - looking young woman , who leant on his arm , and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister ; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever , by being married already .

Henry Tilney	agent	talked	But guided only by what was simple and probable , it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married ; he had not behaved , he had not talked , like the married men to whom she had been used ; he had never mentioned a wife , and he had acknowledged a sister .

Henry Tilney	agent	spoke	She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged .

Henry Tilney	agent	ask	She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe , and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight , lest he should engage her again ; for though she could not , dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to dance , her wishes , hopes , and plans all centred in nothing less . 
Henry Tilney	agent	joining	To escape , and , as she believed , so narrowly escape John Thorpe , and to be asked , so immediately on his joining her , asked by Mr. Tilney , as if he had sought her on purpose!—it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity .

Henry Tilney	agent	repeated	“ Only go and call on Mrs. Allen ! ” he repeated . 
Henry Tilney	agent	joining	On the beginning of the fifth , however , the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father , joining a party in the opposite box , recalled her to anxiety and distress .

Henry Tilney	agent	sat	Catherine was restlessly miserable ; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation . 
Henry Tilney	agent	sat	Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her ; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation — instead of proudly resolving , in conscious innocence , to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it , to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation , and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight , or flirting with somebody else — she took to herself all the shame of misconduct , or at least of its appearance , and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause . The play concluded — the curtain fell — Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat , but his father remained , and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box . 
Henry Tilney	agent	appeared	She was right ; in a few minutes he appeared , and , making his way through the then thinning rows , spoke with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend .

Henry Tilney	agent	said	If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person ’s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . ” “ That little boys and girls should be tormented , ” said Henry , “ is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb ‘ to torment , ’ as I observed to be your own method , instead of ‘ to instruct , ’ supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . ” “ You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . ” “ Very probably .

Henry Tilney	agent	meant	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	made	He made no reply , and was beginning to talk of something else ; but she eagerly continued , “ Why do not you persuade him to go away ?

Henry Tilney	agent	persuade	“ Then you will persuade him to go away ? ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	told	I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . 
Henry Tilney	agent	think	“ I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? 
Henry Tilney	agent	say	I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . 
Henry Tilney	agent	know	I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . 
Henry Tilney	agent	know	Henry Tilney must know best . 
Henry Tilney	agent	drove	; Henry drove so well — so quietly — without making any disturbance , without parading to her , or swearing at them : so different from the only gentleman - coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with ! 
Henry Tilney	agent	driven	to be driven by him , next to being dancing with him , was certainly the greatest happiness in the world . 
Henry Tilney	agent	have	“ Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father ’s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	think	yes — I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house — and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	raised	Well , go on . ” But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther ; he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice , and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda ’s woes .

Henry Tilney	agent	related	Catherine , recollecting herself , grew ashamed of her eagerness , and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related . 
Henry Tilney	agent	described	“ Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described ! 
Henry Tilney	agent	endeavoured	A moment ’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said . 
Henry Tilney	agent	foretold	She seized , with an unsteady hand , the precious manuscript , for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters ; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold , resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest . 
Henry Tilney	agent	know	Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know her folly ! 
Henry Tilney	agent	left	Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston , where business required and would keep him two or three days . 
Henry Tilney	agent	disengaged	Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . 
Henry Tilney	agent	came	“ How came you here ? 
Henry Tilney	agent	came	How came you up that staircase ? ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	came	“ How came I up that staircase ! ” he replied , greatly surprised . “ 
Henry Tilney	agent	replied	“ How came I up that staircase ! ” he replied , greatly surprised . “ 
Henry Tilney	agent	come	Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	seemed	Catherine recollected herself , blushed deeply , and could say no more . He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	“ And may I not , in my turn , ” said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , “ ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	pushed	“ And may I not , in my turn , ” said he , as he pushed back the folding doors , “ ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ”

Henry Tilney	agent	alarmed	I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ” dropping her voice , “ your father was with us . ” “ And that prevented you , ” said Henry , earnestly regarding her . 
Henry Tilney	agent	despise	Her folly , which now seemed even criminal , was all exposed to him , and he must despise her forever . 
Henry Tilney	agent	had	He had — she thought he had , once or twice before this fatal morning , shown something like affection for her . 
Henry Tilney	agent	followed	The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual . 
Henry Tilney	agent	paid	The formidable Henry soon followed her into the room , and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	Henry ’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct , in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed , was of the greatest assistance to her ; and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress , her spirits became absolutely comfortable , and capable , as heretofore , of continual improvement by anything he said . 
Henry Tilney	agent	retreated	She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her . 
Henry Tilney	agent	said	“ I am sorry , ” said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; “ if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ” 
Henry Tilney	agent	opened	“ I am sorry , ” said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; “ if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ”

Henry Tilney	agent	began	Eleanor ’s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment ; but Henry began to suspect the truth , and something , in which Miss Thorpe ’s name was included , passed his lips .

Henry Tilney	agent	thought	And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . 
Henry Tilney	agent	believed	could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed .

Henry Tilney	agent	replied	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance .

Henry Tilney	agent	lay	But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations .

Henry Tilney	agent	intended	Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it . 
Henry Tilney	agent	ask	how can you ask the question ? 
Henry Tilney	agent	go	Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . ”

Henry Tilney	agent	supported	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits .

Henry Tilney	agent	loved	She did — almost always — believe that Henry loved her , and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them ; and believing so far , her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations .

Henry Tilney	agent	see	“ You may see the house from this window , sir , ” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him .

Henry Tilney	agent	delighted	for , though Henry was now sincerely attached to her , though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society 
Henry Tilney	agent	talked	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application . 
Henry Tilney	agent	offered	Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand . 
Henry Tilney	agent	saved	The affrighted Catherine , amidst all the terrors of expectation , as she listened to this account , could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection , by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject ; and as he proceeded to give the particulars , and explain the motives of his father ’s conduct , her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight .

Henry Tilney	agent	supposed	She was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be . 
Henry Tilney	agent	courted	Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims , he had courted her acquaintance in Bath , solicited her company at Northanger , and designed her for his daughter - in - law . 
Henry Tilney	agent	knew	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name . 
Henry Tilney	agent	chose	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light . 
Henry Tilney	agent	seen	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .

Henry Tilney	agent	refused	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand .

Henry Tilney	agent	applied	CHAPTER 31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland ’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was , for a few minutes , considerable , it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side ; but as nothing , after all , could be more natural than Catherine ’s being beloved , they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride , and , as far as they alone were concerned , had not a single objection to start .

Henry Tilney	patient	kept	Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced . 
Henry Tilney	patient	indulged	Catherine feared , as she listened to their discourse , that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others . 
Henry Tilney	patient	Thank	“ Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much .

Henry Tilney	patient	forgot	Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance , and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe . 
Henry Tilney	patient	see	“ But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . ” “ Not see him again ! 
Henry Tilney	patient	see	“ But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . ” “ Not see him again ! 
Henry Tilney	patient	seeing	From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance . 
Henry Tilney	patient	married	But guided only by what was simple and probable , it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married ; he had not behaved , he had not talked , like the married men to whom she had been used ; he had never mentioned a wife , and he had acknowledged a sister . 
Henry Tilney	patient	acknowledged	She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged . 
Henry Tilney	patient	left	very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney 
Henry Tilney	patient	see	Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . ” In this commonplace chatter , which lasted some time , the original subject seemed entirely forgotten ; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while , she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella ’s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney . 
Henry Tilney	patient	meet	“ Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? ” said Mrs. Allen . 
Henry Tilney	patient	drawn	The rest of the evening she found very dull ; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea , to attend that of his partner ; Miss Tilney , though belonging to it , did not sit near her , and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile , one squeeze , and one “ dearest Catherine . ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	see	what would not I give to see him ! 
Henry Tilney	patient	saw	My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world ; she saw him this morning , you know ; you must introduce him to me . 
Henry Tilney	patient	introduce	My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world ; she saw him this morning , you know ; you must introduce him to me .

Henry Tilney	patient	see	“ No , ” said Catherine , “ he is not here ; I can not see him anywhere . ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	know	“ Hum — I do not know him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	address	He was a very handsome man , of a commanding aspect , past the bloom , but not past the vigour of life ; and with his eye still directed towards her , she saw him presently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper . 
Henry Tilney	patient	watch	Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box ; and , for the space of two entire scenes , did she thus watch Henry Tilney , without being once able to catch his eye . No longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play ; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes . 
Henry Tilney	patient	forced	Catherine was restlessly miserable ; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation . 
Henry Tilney	patient	enlighten	Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her ; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation — instead of proudly resolving , in conscious innocence , to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it , to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation , and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight , or flirting with somebody else — she took to herself all the shame of misconduct , or at least of its appearance , and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause . The play concluded — the curtain fell — Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat , but his father remained , and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box . 
Henry Tilney	patient	answered	Not with such calmness was he answered by the latter : “ Oh ! 
Henry Tilney	patient	tell	Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together ? 
Henry Tilney	patient	gone	Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together ? 
Henry Tilney	patient	Thank	“ Yes , ” added Miss Tilney , “ and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . ” “ Thank you , Eleanor — a most honourable testimony . 
Henry Tilney	patient	leave	I shall soon leave you as far behind me as — what shall I say?—I want an appropriate simile.—as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy . 
Henry Tilney	patient	treating	Miss Morland , he is treating you exactly as he does his sister . 
Henry Tilney	patient	leave	Come , Miss Morland , let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction , while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best . 
Henry Tilney	patient	understand	“ And now , Henry , ” said Miss Tilney , “ that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself — unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . 
Henry Tilney	patient	seeing	, from the intercourse of the day , she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before ; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever , in the ease of a family party , he had never said so little , nor been so little agreeable ; and , in spite of their father ’s great civilities to her — in spite of his thanks , invitations , and compliments — it had been a release to get away from him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	influenced	“ With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person ’s feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered — but , How should _ I _ be influenced , What would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so ? 
Henry Tilney	patient	tell	“ But pray tell me what you mean . ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	convinced	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	seeing	What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine ’s speculation . 
Henry Tilney	patient	entreating	She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject , regretting his brother ’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe , and entreating him to make known her prior engagement . 
Henry Tilney	patient	pardon	“ Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	compare	; Henry drove so well — so quietly — without making any disturbance , without parading to her , or swearing at them : so different from the only gentleman - coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with ! 
Henry Tilney	patient	frightened	yes — I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house — and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	amused	Well , go on . ” But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther ; he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice , and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of Matilda ’s woes . 
Henry Tilney	patient	assure	Catherine , recollecting herself , grew ashamed of her eagerness , and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related . 
Henry Tilney	patient	provided	Did Henry ’s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . 
Henry Tilney	patient	miss	“ To be sure you must miss him very much . ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	gave	With a feeling of terror not very definable , she fixed her eyes on the staircase , and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view . 
Henry Tilney	patient	detain	I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ” “ I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . 
Henry Tilney	patient	leave	She could not contradict it , and therefore suffered herself to be detained , though her dread of further questions made her , for the first time in their acquaintance , wish to leave him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	prevented	He was prevented , however , from even looking his surprise by his father ’s entrance . 
Henry Tilney	patient	leave	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	marry	Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! 
Henry Tilney	patient	misinformed	could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ” “ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed . 
Henry Tilney	patient	undervalue	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . 
Henry Tilney	patient	telling	And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	put	You are not to put yourself at all out of your way . 
Henry Tilney	patient	face	I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it .

Henry Tilney	patient	come	A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion , so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston ; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry , about an hour afterwards , came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting , and said , “ I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour .

Witness myself , at this present hour . 
Henry Tilney	patient	obliging	Henry was not able to obey his father ’s injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies , during his absence in London , the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights . 
Henry Tilney	patient	bid	Henry at a distance — not able even to bid him farewell . 
Henry Tilney	patient	obliged	The manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil , hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience , or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling ; of two days , the earliest fixed on , and of that almost the earliest hour , as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning , that he might not be obliged even to see her . 
Henry Tilney	patient	offend	By some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	viewed	If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer , she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house . 
Henry Tilney	patient	forget	She could never forget Henry Tilney , or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment ; but he might forget her ; and in that case , to meet — ! 
Henry Tilney	patient	paying	And on developing , from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply , the meaning , which one short syllable would have given , immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them , and , with a rising colour , asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way . 
Henry Tilney	patient	accompanying	“ You may see the house from this window , sir , ” was information on Sarah ’s side , which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman , and a silencing nod from her mother ; for Mrs. Morland , thinking it probable , as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours , that he might have some explanation to give of his father ’s behaviour , which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine , would not on any account prevent her accompanying him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	explain	Some explanation on his father ’s account he had to give ; but his first purpose was to explain himself , and before they reached 
Henry Tilney	patient	sanctioned	A very short visit to Mrs. Allen , in which Henry talked at random , without sense or connection , and Catherine , wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness , scarcely opened her lips , dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête - à - tête ; and before it was suffered to close , she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application . 
Henry Tilney	patient	met	On his return from Woodston , two days before , he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland ’s departure , and ordered to think of her no more . 
Henry Tilney	patient	misled	John Thorpe had first misled him . 
Henry Tilney	patient	induced	Thorpe , most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney ’s importance , had been joyfully and proudly communicative ; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland ’s engaging Isabella , but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself , his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them . 
Henry Tilney	patient	convinced	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error . 
Henry Tilney	patient	assist	I leave it to my reader ’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine , how much of it he could have learnt from his father , in what points his own conjectures might assist him , and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James . 
Henry Tilney	patient	obliged	He blushed for the narrow - minded counsel which he was obliged to expose . 
Henry Tilney	patient	intimidate	But , in such a cause , his anger , though it must shock , could not intimidate Henry , who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice . 
Henry Tilney	patient	offering	He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire , an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine , and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand . 
Henry Tilney	patient	threw	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ” 
Henry Tilney	patient	married	The event which it authorized soon followed : Henry and Catherine were married , the bells rang , and everybody smiled ; and , as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting 
General Tilney	agent	moved	With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the General , as he moved through the crowd , and “ How handsome a family they are ! ” was her secret remark . 
General Tilney	agent	thinks	and the General thinks you the finest girl in Bath . ” 
General Tilney	agent	declared	The General declared he could say no more ; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded ; but on some other day he trusted , when longer notice could be given , they would not refuse to spare her to her friend .

General Tilney	agent	attended	The General attended her himself to the street - door , saying everything gallant as they went downstairs , admiring the elasticity of her walk , which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing , and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld , when they parted . 
General Tilney	agent	expressed	Her tranquillity was not improved by the General ’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son , nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down . 
General Tilney	agent	fixed	The clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down , and the General had fixed to be out of Milsom Street by that hour . 
General Tilney	agent	taking	At last , however , the order of release was given ; and much was Catherine then surprised by the General ’s proposal of her taking his place in his son ’s curricle for the rest of the journey 
General Tilney	agent	seeing	: “ the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . ” 
General Tilney	agent	blush	The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France .

General Tilney	agent	chosen	Half the time would have been enough for the curricle , and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move , that , had not the General chosen to have his own carriage lead the way , they could have passed it with ease in half a minute . 
General Tilney	agent	had	In addition to every other delight , she had now that of listening to her own praise ; of being thanked at least , on his sister ’s account , for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor ; of hearing it ranked as real friendship , and described as creating real gratitude . 
General Tilney	agent	waiting	A sudden scud of rain , driving full in her face , made it impossible for her to observe anything further , and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet ; and she was actually under the abbey walls , was springing , with Henry ’s assistance , from the carriage , was beneath the shelter of the old porch , and had even passed on to the hall , where her friend and the General were waiting to welcome her , without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself , or one moment ’s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice . 
General Tilney	agent	preserving	The windows , to which she looked with peculiar dependence , from having heard the General talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with 
General Tilney	agent	began	The General , perceiving how her eye was employed , began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture , where everything , being for daily use , pretended only to comfort , etc . ; flattering himself , however , that there were some apartments in the Abbey not unworthy her notice — and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular , when , taking out his watch , he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five !

General Tilney	agent	spent	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace . 
General Tilney	agent	look	Of the former , she spoke aloud her admiration ; and the General , with a very gracious countenance , acknowledged that it was by no means an ill - sized room , and further confessed that , though as careless on such subjects as most people , he did look upon a tolerably large eating - room as one of the necessaries of life ; he supposed , however , “ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”

General Tilney	agent	seen	The manufacture was much improved since that time ; he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town , and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind , might have been tempted to order a new set . He trusted , however , that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one — though not for himself .

General Tilney	agent	mount	They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse , and immediately on re - entering the breakfast - room , Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure . 
General Tilney	agent	observed	“ This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ” observed the General to Eleanor . 
General Tilney	agent	think	I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations .

General Tilney	agent	take	It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . 
General Tilney	agent	think	Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . 
General Tilney	agent	listened	The General listened with assenting gratitude ; and it seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour .

General Tilney	agent	led	The kitchen - garden was to be next admired , and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park . 
General Tilney	agent	forced	The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom .

General Tilney	agent	suffered	Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired .

General Tilney	agent	perceived	He perceived her inclination , and having again urged the plea of health in vain , was too polite to make further opposition . 
General Tilney	agent	meet	He excused himself , however , from attending them : “ The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ” 
General Tilney	agent	turned	He turned away ; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation . The shock , however , being less real than the relief , offered it no injury ; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired . “ I am particularly fond of this spot , ” said her companion , with a sigh .

General Tilney	agent	behaved	And besides , handsome as he was , there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her . “ Her picture , I suppose , ” blushing at the consummate art of her own question , “ hangs in your father ’s room ? ” “ No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place .

General Tilney	agent	smiled	She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the General ; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation , she found herself again obliged to walk with him , listen to him , and even to smile when he smiled . 
General Tilney	agent	perceived	began to walk with lassitude ; the General perceived it , and with a concern for her health , which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him , was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house . 
General Tilney	agent	came	An hour passed away before the General came in , spent , on the part of his young guest , in no very favourable consideration of his character . 
General Tilney	agent	appeared	At length he appeared ; and , whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations , he could still smile with _ them _ . 
General Tilney	agent	led	being , contrary to Catherine ’s expectations , unprovided with any pretence for further delay , beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return , was at last ready to escort them . They set forward ; and , with a grandeur of air , a dignified step , which caught the eye , but could not shake the doubts of the well - read Catherine , he led the way across the hall , through the common drawing - room and one useless antechamber , into a room magnificent both in size and furniture — the real drawing - room , used only with company of consequence . 
General Tilney	agent	supplied	It was very noble — very grand — very charming!—was all that Catherine had to say , for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin ; and all minuteness of praise , all praise that had much meaning , was supplied by the General 
General Tilney	agent	satisfied	When the General had satisfied his own curiosity , in a close examination of every well - known ornament , they proceeded into the library , an apartment , in its way , of equal magnificence , exhibiting a collection of books , on which an humble man might have looked with pride . 
General Tilney	agent	forgo	From the dining - room , of which , though already seen , and always to be seen at five o’clock , the General could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length , for the more certain information of Miss Morland , as to what she neither doubted nor cared for , they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen — the ancient kitchen of the convent , rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days , and in the stoves and hot closets of the present . 
General Tilney	agent	allowed	had the General allowed it 
General Tilney	agent	had	but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on . 
General Tilney	agent	called	The gallery was terminated by folding doors , which Miss Tilney , advancing , had thrown open , and passed through , and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left , in another long reach of gallery , when the General , coming forwards , called her hastily , and , as Catherine thought , rather angrily back , demanding whither she were going?—And what was there more to be seen?—Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth her notice?—And did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise ? 
General Tilney	agent	entered	It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience . 
General Tilney	agent	given	In the high - arched passage , paved with stone , which already she had trodden with peculiar awe , she well remembered the doors of which the General had given no account . 
General Tilney	agent	passed	The side of the quadrangle , in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting , being , according to her belief , just opposite her own , it struck her that , if judiciously watched , some rays of light from the General ’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows , as he passed to the prison of his wife ; and , twice before she stepped into bed , she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery , to see if it appeared ; but all abroad was dark , and it must yet be too early . The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up . 
General Tilney	agent	required	It was Sunday , and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the General in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home ; and great as was Catherine ’s curiosity , her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner , either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o’clock , or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp . 
General Tilney	agent	sit	That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine .

General Tilney	agent	named	The breakfast - room was gay with company ; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of his daughter , in a complimentary style , which so well concealed his resentful ire , as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present . 
General Tilney	agent	had	No : whatever might have been the General ’s crimes , he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection . 
General Tilney	agent	seemed	To be found there , even by a servant , would be unpleasant ; but by the General ( and he seemed always at hand when least wanted ) , much worse ! 
General Tilney	agent	had	The General , between his cocoa and his newspaper , had luckily no leisure for noticing her ; but to the other two her distress was equally visible . 
General Tilney	agent	utter	which she had more than once heard him utter , and which tempted her to think 
General Tilney	agent	catch	She proposed it to him accordingly ; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected . 
General Tilney	agent	said	“ No , ” said he , “ my father ’s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick ’s confession of folly need not be 
General Tilney	agent	tell	He must tell his own story . 
General Tilney	agent	tell	“ But he will tell only half of it . ” 
General Tilney	agent	expressed	He often expressed his uneasiness on this head , feared the sameness of every day ’s society and employments would disgust her with the place , wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country , talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner , and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood .

General Tilney	agent	desired	When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . ” 
General Tilney	agent	said	You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ” “ I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own .

General Tilney	agent	seemed	Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed . 
General Tilney	agent	called	Catherine ’s mind was too full , as she entered the house , for her either to observe or to say a great deal ; and , till called on by the General for her opinion of it , she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting . 
General Tilney	agent	said	“ We are not calling it a good house , ” said he . 
General Tilney	agent	believe	“ We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger — we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good . 
General Tilney	agent	fit	why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ? 
General Tilney	agent	trust	“ I trust , ” said the General , with a most satisfied smile , “ that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ” 
General Tilney	agent	said	“ I trust , ” said the General , with a most satisfied smile , “ that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ” 
General Tilney	agent	like	“ You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough . 
General Tilney	agent	approve	“ You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough . 
General Tilney	agent	applied	” Such a compliment recalled all Catherine ’s consciousness , and silenced her directly ; and , though pointedly applied to by the General for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings , nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her . 
General Tilney	agent	eat	They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own , and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter ’s being oiled . At six o’clock , the General having taken his coffee , the carriage again received them ; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit , so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations , that , could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son , Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it .

General Tilney	agent	found	CHAPTER 28 Soon after this , the General found himself obliged to go to London for a week ; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland ’s company , and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence .

General Tilney	agent	came	Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day ; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one , and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other , she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy ; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit ; before the General came home , the fourth week would be turned , and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer . 
General Tilney	agent	send	The General will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way — and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . ” 
General Tilney	agent	had	The General had had nothing to accuse her of , nothing to lay to her charge , but her being the involuntary , unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon , and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own . 
General Tilney	agent	inquired	The General , perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss Morland , had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her than her name . 
General Tilney	agent	had	For Catherine , however , the peculiar object of the General ’s curiosity , and his own speculations , he had yet something more in reserve , and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen ’s estate . 
General Tilney	agent	boasted	Thorpe ’s interest in the family , by his sister ’s approaching connection with one of its members , and his own views on another ( circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness ) , seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth ; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless , of Miss Morland ’s being under their care , and — as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge — of their treating her with parental kindness .

That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race .

General Tilney	agent	knew	The Allens , he believed , had lived near them too long , and he knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve . 
General Tilney	agent	needed	The General needed no more . 
General Tilney	agent	set	Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself , he set out the next day for the abbey , where his performances have been seen . 
General Tilney	agent	prepared	The General , accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family , prepared for no reluctance but of feeling , no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words , could ill brook the opposition of his son , steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it . 
General Tilney	agent	come	while his parent so expressly forbade the connection , they could not allow themselves to encourage it . That the General should come forward to solicit the alliance , or that he should even very heartily approve it , they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation ; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded , and that once obtained — and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied — their willing approbation was instantly to follow . 
General Tilney	agent	loved	His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “ Your Ladyship ! ”

General Tilney	agent	allow	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give .

General Tilney	agent	admire	Thorpe , however , would see her to her chair , and , till she entered it , continued the same kind of delicate flattery , in spite of her entreating him to have done . That General Tilney , instead of disliking , should admire her , was very delightful ; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet . 
General Tilney	agent	asking	And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence , it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever , if not his place , by her rapidity . After sitting with them a quarter of an hour , she rose to take leave , and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney ’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her . 
General Tilney	agent	received	She could not listen to that with perfect calmness , but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment , wished she could have known his intention , wished she could have seen him before he went , as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother , and her kind compliments to all the Skinners . CHAPTER 16 Catherine ’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable ; and accordingly , though she was most politely received by General Tilney , and kindly welcomed by his daughter , though Henry was at home , and no one else of the party , she found , on her return , without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings , that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded . 
General Tilney	agent	said	“ Since they can consent to part with you , ” said he , “ we may expect philosophy from all the world . ” 
General Tilney	agent	propose	The remembrance of Mr. Allen ’s opinion , respecting young men ’s open carriages , made her blush at the mention of such a plan , and her first thought was to decline it ; but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney ’s judgment ; he could not propose anything improper for her ; and , in the course of a few minutes , she found herself with Henry in the curricle , as happy a being as ever existed . A very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world ; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur , to be sure , but it was a heavy and troublesome business , and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at Petty France .

General Tilney	agent	acted	here , when the whole was unfolded , was an insult not to be overlooked , nor , for the first half hour , to be easily pardoned . Without suffering any romantic alarm , in the consideration of their daughter ’s long and lonely journey , Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her ; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered ; and that , in forcing her on such a measure , General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly — neither as a gentleman nor as a parent . 
General Tilney	agent	done	Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “ it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour .

General Tilney	patient	follow	With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the General , as he moved through the crowd , and “ How handsome a family they are ! ” was her secret remark .

General Tilney	patient	flattering	The General , perceiving how her eye was employed , began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture , where everything , being for daily use , pretended only to comfort , etc . ; flattering himself , however , that there were some apartments in the Abbey not unworthy her notice — and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular , when , taking out his watch , he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five ! 
General Tilney	patient	disobliging	Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point , she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything , as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay . 
General Tilney	patient	enchanted	He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste , confessed it to be neat and simple , thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country ; and for his part , to his uncritical palate , the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire , as from that of Dresden or Sêve . 
General Tilney	patient	understand	Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him . 
General Tilney	patient	keep	Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston , where business required and would keep him two or three days . 
General Tilney	patient	flattered	The General was flattered by her looks of surprise , which told him almost as plainly , as he soon forced her to tell him in words , that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before ; and he then modestly owned that , “ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom .

General Tilney	patient	entered	With a triumphant smile of self - satisfaction , the General wished he could do the same , for he never entered his , without being vexed in some way or other , by its falling short of his plan . 
General Tilney	patient	excused	He excused himself , however , from attending them : “ The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ” 
General Tilney	patient	placed	His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent . 
General Tilney	patient	convinced	but if he had a vanity , it was in the arrangement of his offices ; and as he was convinced that , to a mind like Miss Morland ’s , a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened , must always be gratifying , he should make no apology for leading her on . 
General Tilney	patient	followed	what that something was , a short sentence of Miss Tilney ’s , as they followed the General at some distance downstairs , seemed to point out : “ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ” were all her words ; but few as they were , they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine . 
General Tilney	patient	left	It was no wonder that the General should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain ; a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed , which released his suffering wife , and left him to the stings of conscience . 
General Tilney	patient	perceiving	An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him , yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye ; and when her friend , who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her , had joined and disappeared with him , she ran for safety to her own room , and , locking herself in , believed that she should never have courage to go down again . 
General Tilney	patient	attend	She remained there at least an hour , in the greatest agitation , deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend , and expecting a summons herself from the angry General to attend him in his own apartment . 
General Tilney	patient	meet	No summons , however , arrived ; and at last , on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey , she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors . 
General Tilney	patient	in	The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money , 
General Tilney	patient	enabling	But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella ’s conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the General by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations .

General Tilney	patient	take	And it all ended , at last , in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston , they would take him by surprise there some day or other , and eat their mutton with him . 
General Tilney	patient	disappointed	Upon looking round it then , she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world ; but she was too guarded to say so , and the coldness of her praise disappointed him . 
General Tilney	patient	restored	Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it ; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry , at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant , the General was shortly restored to his complacency , and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits . 
General Tilney	patient	satisfy	The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General . 
General Tilney	patient	rob	CHAPTER 28 Soon after this , the General found himself obliged to go to London for a week ; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland ’s company , and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence . 
General Tilney	patient	offended	“ Have I offended the General ? ” said Catherine in a faltering voice . 
General Tilney	patient	seen	He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so . 
General Tilney	patient	offended	“ I am sure , ” said she , “ I am very sorry if I have offended him . 
General Tilney	patient	hurried	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .

General Tilney	patient	loved	His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties ; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship , utility , and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “ Your Ladyship ! ” 
General Tilney	patient	informed	Concerning the one in question , therefore , I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing - bills , resulting from a long visit at Northanger , by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures . The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother ’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland ’s circumstances which , as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed , they were qualified to give . 
General Tilney	patient	taught	It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe ’s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it ; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor , and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds . This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride ; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence , which he was at some pains to procure , that the Fullerton estate , being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor , was consequently open to every greedy speculation . 
General Tilney	patient	provoked	Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “ it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour . 
General Tilney	patient	see	Catherine took up her work directly , saying , in a dejected voice , that “ her head did not run upon Bath — much . ” “ Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again . 
General Tilney	patient	suspecting	Catherine , at any rate , heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife , she had scarcely sinned against his character , or magnified his cruelty . 
General Tilney	patient	saw	and , when she saw him in the evening , while she worked with her friend , slowly pacing the drawing - room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness , with downcast eyes and contracted brow , she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him .

John Thorpe	agent	thought	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening .

John Thorpe	agent	procured	In a very few minutes she reappeared , having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise , after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen ’s admiration of his gig ; and then receiving her friend ’s parting good wishes , they both hurried downstairs .

John Thorpe	agent	sit	Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one , but it was too late to retreat , and she was too young to own herself frightened ; so , resigning herself to her fate , and trusting to the animal ’s boasted knowledge of its owner , she sat peaceably down , and saw Thorpe sit down by her . 
John Thorpe	agent	saying	A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue ; it was broken by Thorpe ’s saying very abruptly , “ Old Allen is as rich as a Jew — is not he ? ” 
John Thorpe	agent	chose	His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject , his rapidity of expression , and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power ; she could strike out nothing new in commendation , but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert , and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in England , his carriage the neatest , his horse the best goer , and himself the best coachman .

John Thorpe	agent	lashed	Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot ; the Tilneys , who had soon ceased to look after her , were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place , and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace .

John Thorpe	agent	chanced	Henry and Eleanor , perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father ’s particular respect , had seen with astonishment the suddenness , continuance , and extent of his attention ; and though latterly , from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her , Henry was convinced of his father ’s believing it to be an advantageous connection , it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on . That they were false , the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them , from Thorpe himself , whom he had chanced to meet again in town , and who , under the influence of exactly opposite feelings , irritated by Catherine ’s refusal , and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella , convinced that they were separated forever , and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable , hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands — confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character , misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit , whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither ; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families , with the most liberal proposals , he had , on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator , been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support . They were , in fact , a necessitous family ; numerous , too , almost beyond example ; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood , as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering ; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant ; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections ; a forward , bragging , scheming race . The terrified General pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look ; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error .

John Thorpe	patient	recommend	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ” 
John Thorpe	patient	gone	The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated ; and James , who had been engaged quite as long as his sister , was very importunate with Isabella to stand up ; but John was gone into the card - room to speak to a friend , and nothing , she declared , should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too . 
John Thorpe	patient	finding	made her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could , in the hope of finding him still with them — a hope which , when it proved to be fruitless , she felt to have been highly unreasonable . 
John Thorpe	patient	resolved	“ He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ” “ Where can he be ? ” said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . 
John Thorpe	patient	hear	As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes , Catherine ’s agony began ; she fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her , hid herself as much as possible from his view , and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him . 
John Thorpe	patient	tell	I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself , but you and John must keep us in countenance . 
John Thorpe	patient	walked	John is just walked off , but he will be back in a moment . ” 
John Thorpe	patient	expect	That she might not appear , however , to observe or expect him , she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan ; and a self - condemnation for her folly , in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time , had just passed through her mind , when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance , by Mr. Tilney himself . 
John Thorpe	patient	escape	To escape , and , as she believed , so narrowly escape John Thorpe , and to be asked , so immediately on his joining her , asked by Mr. Tilney , as if he had sought her on purpose!—it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity . 
John Thorpe	patient	asked	“ I wonder you should think so , for you never asked me . ” “ That is a good one , by Jove ! 
John Thorpe	patient	quiz	And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room ; and when they see you standing up with somebody else , they will quiz me famously . 
John Thorpe	patient	engaged	But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . ” 
John Thorpe	patient	engaged	While talking to each other , she had observed with some surprise that John Thorpe , who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together , was engaged in conversation with General Tilney ; and she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse . 
John Thorpe	patient	depended	The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on . 
John Thorpe	patient	see	“ And I hope — I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . ” 
John Thorpe	patient	concern	It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me . 
John Thorpe	patient	see	it must be all and completely a mistake — for I did not see him once that whole morning . ” 
John Thorpe	patient	seeing	I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes — 
John Thorpe	patient	undeceive	Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . 
John Thorpe	patient	tell	Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . 
John Thorpe	patient	seeing	From this state of humiliation , she was roused , at the end of ten minutes , to a pleasanter feeling , by seeing , not Mr. Thorpe , but Mr. Tilney , within three yards of the place where they sat ; he seemed to be moving that way , but he did not see her , and therefore the smile and the blush , which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine , passed away without sullying her heroic importance . 
John Thorpe	patient	spare	Can you spare me for an hour or two ? 
John Thorpe	patient	followed	She followed him in all his admiration as well as she could . 
John Thorpe	patient	endangered	He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums ; of racing matches , in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner ; of shooting parties , in which he had killed more birds ( though without having one good shot ) than all his companions together ; and described to her some famous day ’s sport , with the fox - hounds , in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman , and in which the boldness of his riding , though it had never endangered his own life for a moment , had been constantly leading others into difficulties , which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many . 
John Thorpe	patient	recommend	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure . 
John Thorpe	patient	entreated	, she entreated him to stop . 
John Thorpe	patient	encouraged	But Mr. Thorpe only laughed , smacked his whip , encouraged his horse , made odd noises , and drove on ; and Catherine , angry and vexed as she was , having no power of getting away , was obliged to give up the point and submit . 
John Thorpe	patient	deceive	“ How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? 
John Thorpe	patient	defended	Thorpe defended himself very stoutly , declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life , and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself . 
John Thorpe	patient	seen	Thorpe defended himself very stoutly , declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life , and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself . 
John Thorpe	patient	begged	“ But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk ; I never thought of such a thing ; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop ; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you ; now , Mrs. Allen , did not — Oh ! 
John Thorpe	patient	know	“ But how came you to know him ? 
John Thorpe	patient	Know	“ Know him ! 
John Thorpe	patient	met	I have met him forever at the Bedford ; and I knew his face again to - day the moment he came into the billiard - room . 
John Thorpe	patient	beat	at first : the odds were five to four against me ; and , if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world — I took his ball exactly — but I could not make you understand it without a table ; however , I _ did _ beat him . 
John Thorpe	patient	say	I should like to dine with him ; I dare say he gives famous dinners . 
John Thorpe	patient	drive	“ Thank ye , ” cried Thorpe , “ but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool . 
John Thorpe	patient	mistaken	This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has — He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday . 
John Thorpe	patient	withheld	Thorpe would have darted after her , but Morland withheld him . 
John Thorpe	patient	encourage	Catherine , with all the earnestness of truth , expressed her astonishment at such a charge , protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe ’s being in love with her , and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him . 
James Morland	agent	led	James and Isabella led the way ; and so well 
James Morland	agent	said	Had she been older or vainer , such attacks might have done little ; but , where youth and diffidence are united , it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world , and of being so very early engaged as a partner ; and the consequence was that , when the two Morlands , after sitting an hour with the Thorpes , set off to walk together to Mr. Allen ’s , and James , as the door was closed on them , said , “ Well , Catherine , how do you like 
James Morland	agent	accepted	James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet .

James Morland	agent	get	“ My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? 
James Morland	agent	think	“ And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? ” “ Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . 
James Morland	agent	happen	Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . ” In this commonplace chatter , which lasted some time , the original subject seemed entirely forgotten ; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while , she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella ’s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney . 
James Morland	agent	said	It would make us the talk of the place , if we were not to change partners . ” “ Upon my honour , ” said James , “ in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . ” “ Nonsense , how can you say so ?

James Morland	agent	drink	However , I am sure James does not drink so much . 
James Morland	agent	assured	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure . 
James Morland	agent	attended	The female part of the Thorpe family , attended by James Morland , appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour , and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend . James , who was now in constant attendance , maintained a similar position , and separating themselves from the rest of their party , they walked in that manner for some time , till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which , confining her entirely to her friend and brother , gave her very little share in the notice of either .

James Morland	agent	coming	james ’s coming ( my eldest brother ) is quite delightful — and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already .

James Morland	agent	have	i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself . 
James Morland	agent	set	In a private consultation between Isabella and James , the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going , and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her , it was agreed that , provided the weather were fair , the party should take place on the following morning ; and they were to set off very early , in order to be at home in good time .

James Morland	agent	linger	I can not bear to see you linger so . 
James Morland	agent	insist	There , go , go — I insist on it . ” The two friends , with hearts now more united than ever , were inseparable for the day ; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along . 
James Morland	agent	write	The letter , whence sprang all this felicity , was short , containing little more than this assurance of success ; and every particular was deferred till James could write again . 
James Morland	agent	expressed	James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude ; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry , being , however unwelcome , no more than he had expected , was borne by him without discontent .

James Morland	agent	finds	If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . 
James Morland	agent	sit	“ It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life .

James Morland	agent	come	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”

James Morland	agent	written	She thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	talked	You talked of expected horrors in London — and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George ’s Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	see	’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	say	“ What say you , Eleanor ? 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	believe	It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	see	Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	used	At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	promised	She ventured , when next alone with Eleanor , to express her wish of being permitted to see it , as well as all the rest of that side of the house ; and Eleanor promised to attend her there , whenever they should have a convenient hour . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	know	It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	leave	“ Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	take	It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	described	After a short silence , during which he had closely observed her , he added , “ As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother ’s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	retreated	She turned into the drawing - room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	expressed	She drew back , trying to beg their pardon , but was , with gentle violence , forced to return ; and the others withdrew , after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her . After half an hour ’s free indulgence of grief and reflection , Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends ; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	hope	Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”

Eleanor Tilney	agent	decided	, in a “ Good heaven ! what can be the matter ? ” it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother , whose arrival was often as sudden , if not quite so unseasonable , and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	come	In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	hoped	After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	remained	Soon after six Eleanor entered her room , eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible ; but very little remained to be done . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	brought	But the knowledge would have been useless here ; it was not called for ; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial — Eleanor brought no message . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	seemed	Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	write	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	advanced	The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks , and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	make	well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	meet	“ If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	obtained	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	attended	separated from all her party , and away from all her acquaintance ; one mortification succeeded another , and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson , that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady . From such a moralizing strain as this , she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder , and turning round , perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her , attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	expressing	The young ladies were introduced to each other , Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness , Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation ; and Mrs. Hughes , satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge , returned to her party . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	had	Miss Tilney had a good figure , a pretty face , and a very agreeable countenance ; and her air , though it had not all the decided pretension , the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe ’s , had more real elegance .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	sit	The rest of the evening she found very dull ; Mr. Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea , to attend that of his partner ; Miss Tilney , though belonging to it , did not sit near her , and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile , one squeeze , and one “ dearest Catherine . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	got	Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ” “ And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? ” “ I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	think	“ Perhaps we — Yes , I think we certainly shall . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	spoke	Miss Tilney , to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar , spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too ; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her , it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk , some morning or other .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	call	“ I can not go , because”—looking down as she spoke , fearful of Isabella ’s smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	leaning	Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother ’s arm , walking slowly down the street . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	When everything was settled , when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well , it was quite ridiculous , quite absurd , to make any further objection .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	go	Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	had	Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	introduced	The affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father , and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe ’s information to her mind , and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	added	Miss Tilney added her own wishes . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	added	“ Yes , ” added Miss Tilney , “ and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . ” “ Thank you , Eleanor — a most honourable testimony .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	thought	But I really thought before , young men despised novels amazingly . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	“ Henry , ” said Miss Tilney , “ you are very impertinent . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	— the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . ” “ Historians , you think , ” said Miss Tilney , “ are not happy in their flights of fancy . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	like	In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one ’s own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	read	If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made — and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	hope	but I hope your friend ’s accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	“ And now , Henry , ” said Miss Tilney , “ that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself — unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	think	“ Miss Morland , I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world — especially of those — whoever they may be — with whom I happen to be in company . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	do	“ Miss Morland , no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	assure	But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	petitioned	The whole walk was delightful , and though it ended too soon , its conclusion was delightful too ; her friends attended her into the house , and Miss Tilney , before they parted , addressing herself with respectful form , as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine , petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	took	Miss Tilney took pains to be near her , and Henry asked her to dance .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	told	No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen ’s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father ’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week . Here was a blow ! 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	says	Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp . ”

Eleanor Tilney	agent	put	“ Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described ! 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	led	On one side it had a range of doors , and it was lighted on the other by windows which Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle , before Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber , and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable , left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	hinted	Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late ; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together , in an alarm not wholly unfounded , for General Tilney was pacing the drawing - room , his watch in his hand , and having , on the very instant of their entering , pulled the bell with violence , ordered “ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ” Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke , and sat pale and breathless , in a most humble mood , concerned for his children , and detesting old chests ; and the General , recovering his politeness as he looked at her , spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend , who was absolutely out of breath from haste , when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world : but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself , till they were happily seated at the dinner - table , when the General ’s complacent smiles , and a good appetite of her own , restored her to peace .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	slept	Thus wisely fortifying her mind , as she proceeded upstairs , she was enabled , especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her , to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart ; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	pointed	She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections , and found her way with all speed to the breakfast - parlour , as it had been pointed out to her by Miss Tilney the evening before . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	saying	He left the room , and Catherine , with a disappointed , anxious face , began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination , under a mistaken idea of pleasing her ; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney ’s saying , with a little confusion , “ I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	embarrassed	Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed ? 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	“ This is so favourite a walk of mine , ” said Miss Tilney , “ that I always think it the best and nearest way . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	continuing	Miss Tilney continuing silent , she ventured to say , “ Her death must have been a great affliction ! ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	revived	Miss Tilney , understanding in part her friend ’s curiosity to see the house , soon revived the subject ; and her father 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	drew	Miss Tilney drew back directly , and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine , who , having seen , in a momentary glance beyond them , a narrower passage , more numerous openings , and symptoms of a winding staircase , believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice ; and felt , as she unwillingly paced back the gallery , that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest .

Eleanor Tilney	agent	said	“ No , ” said Miss Tilney , sighing ; “ I was unfortunately from home . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	arrived	Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	read	Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune . 
Eleanor Tilney	agent	began	Miss Tilney , at Catherine ’s invitation , now read the letter likewise , and , having expressed also her concern and surprise , began to inquire into Miss Thorpe ’s connections and fortune . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	congratulate	After addressing her with his usual politeness , he turned to his daughter and said , “ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ” “ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ” “ Well , proceed by all means . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	told	We leave Bath , as she has perhaps told you , on Saturday se’nnight . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	tempt	’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	leave	“ I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	called	Again they parted — but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	declared	Eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	collect	She said nothing ; and Eleanor , endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness , but with eyes still cast down , soon went on . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	obliged	“ You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	trust	After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	called	Let me be called in time . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	allowed	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	importune	I will not importune you . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	addressing	The strength of these feelings , however , was far from assisting her pen ; and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor Tilney . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	pained	To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation , convey gratitude without servile regret , be guarded without coldness , and honest without resentment — a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of — and , above all , which she might not blush herself , if Henry should chance to see , was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance ; and , after long thought and much perplexity , to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	thrown	It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in

Eleanor Tilney	patient	seeing	Catherine ’s silent appeal to her friend , meanwhile , was entirely thrown away , for Mrs. Allen , not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look , was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else ; and Catherine , whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive , and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe , as Isabella was going at the same time with James , was therefore obliged to speak plainer . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	meet	Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to James . Catherine ’s resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning ; and till the usual moment of going to the pump - room , she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	engaged	“ He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening , when he saw me sitting down . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	asked	“ Yes , sometimes ; but he has rid out this morning with my father . ” Mrs. Hughes now joined them , and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to go . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	saw	issuing from the door , she saw Miss Tilney herself . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	saw	“ But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk ; I never thought of such a thing ; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop ; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you ; now , Mrs. Allen , did not — Oh ! 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	tell	“ It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement , and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	led	This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has — He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	hold	Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	owning	Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it .

Eleanor Tilney	patient	startled	Miss Tilney , to whom this was chiefly addressed , was startled , and hastily replied , “ Indeed ! 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	satisfy	“ Miss Morland , do not mind what he says ; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	addressing	The whole walk was delightful , and though it ended too soon , its conclusion was delightful too ; her friends attended her into the house , and Miss Tilney , before they parted , addressing herself with respectful form , as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine , petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next . 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	visited	In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged , she visited Miss Tilney , and poured 
Eleanor Tilney	patient	justified	As soon as breakfast was over , she sat down to fulfil her promise to Miss Tilney , whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend ’s disposition was already justified , for already did Catherine reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly , with having never enough valued her merits or kindness , and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure .

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	begun	For a moment Catherine was surprised ; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland , before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college , of the name of Thorpe ; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with his family , near London .

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	remembered	For a moment Catherine was surprised ; but Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with Mr. James Morland , before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college , of the name of Thorpe ; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with his family , near London . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	command	The whole being explained , many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her ; of being considered as already friends , through the friendship of their brothers , etc . , which Catherine heard with pleasure , and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command ; and , as the first proof of amity , she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe , and take a turn with her about the room . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	talked	Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance , and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	looked	Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening , in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe , though they certainly claimed much of her leisure , as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach ; but she looked in vain . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	felt	She hoped to be more fortunate the next day ; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning , she hardly felt a doubt of it ; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants , and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	learn	From the Thorpes she could learn nothing , for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	indulged	It was a subject , however , in which she often indulged with her fair friend , from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him ; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	found	She had found some acquaintance , had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend ; and , as the completion of good fortune , had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	spent	They were changed into , “ How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ” and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns .

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	looked	satisfied was the latter with her lot , so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother ’s friend , and her friend ’s brother , so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings , that , though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street , she was so far from seeking to attract their notice , that she looked back at them only three times . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	do	“ Ah , Mother ! How do you do ? ” said he , giving her a hearty shake of the hand . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	get	“ Where did you get that quiz of a hat ? 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	look	It makes you look like an old witch . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	done	” instead of answering , as she probably would have done , had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case , “ I do not like him at all , ” she directly replied , “ I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable .

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	believe	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	wish	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you .

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	see	“ Because I thought I should soon see you myself . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	hope	I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	dare	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	know	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	know	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	ask	I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	hope	“ And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . ” “ Thank you , sir . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	move	, was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . ” “ That circumstance must give great encouragement . ” “ Yes , sir — and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months ; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away . ” Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen , that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats , as they had agreed to join their party . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	said	“ I beg your pardon , Miss Morland , ” said she , “ for this liberty — but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe , and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	said	“ Well , my dear , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , impatient for praise of her son , “ I hope you have had an agreeable partner . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	hope	“ Well , my dear , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , impatient for praise of her son , “ I hope you have had an agreeable partner . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	thought	“ He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ” “ Where can he be ? ” said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance .

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	said	after a short silence , she added , “ he is a very agreeable young man . ” “ Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; “ I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . ” This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment ’s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , “ I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . ” Catherine was disappointed and vexed . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	said	“ So Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	says	She says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning , it is so uncommonly scarce . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	dresses	and I fancy , by what I can learn , that she always dresses very handsomely . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	choose	She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	getting	She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	pointing	To Catherine ’s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their “ I know what ” ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	dare	There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	heard	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”

Mrs. Thorpe	agent	do	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure . 
Mrs. Thorpe	agent	said	“ Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , “ we perfectly see into your heart . 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	invited	The whole being explained , many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her ; of being considered as already friends , through the friendship of their brothers , etc . , which Catherine heard with pleasure , and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command ; and , as the first proof of amity , she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe , and take a turn with her about the room . 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	experienced	Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion — but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced . 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	met	This critique , the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine , brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe ’s lodgings , and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son , as they met Mrs. Thorpe , who had descried them from above , in the passage . 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	assuring	These manners did not please Catherine ; but he was James ’s friend and Isabella ’s brother ; and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella ’s assuring her , when they withdrew to see the new hat , that John thought her the most charming girl in the world , and by John ’s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening .

Mrs. Thorpe	patient	Thank	“ And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . ” “ Thank you , sir . 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	seen	“ You have seen Mrs. Thorpe , then ? ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	wonder	it is not right ; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it . 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	allowed	Mrs. Thorpe and her son , who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland ’s consent , to consider Isabella ’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family , were allowed to join their counsels , and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters . 
Mrs. Thorpe	patient	set	To Catherine ’s simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant , nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend ; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their “ I know what ” ; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit , a display of family ingenuity , on one side in the mystery of an affected secret , on the other of undefined discovery , all equally acute

Frederick Tilney	agent	wish	“ I wish your heart were independent . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	have	what can you have to do with hearts ? 
Frederick Tilney	agent	falling	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	think	That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	go	Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? 
Frederick Tilney	agent	thank	Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? 
Frederick Tilney	agent	think	He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	have	He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	leave	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us .

Frederick Tilney	agent	return	His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	came	Her tranquillity was not improved by the General ’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son , nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	has	Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	saw	, Frederick and I ( _ we _ were both at home ) saw her repeatedly ; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her , or which her situation in life could command .

Frederick Tilney	agent	marrying	my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ” “ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ” recollecting with a blush the last line . “ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ” “ No , read it yourself , ” cried Catherine , whose second thoughts were clearer .

Frederick Tilney	agent	followed	He went into the pump - room afterwards ; but I would not have followed him for all the world .

Frederick Tilney	agent	harbours	Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	told	Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take .

Frederick Tilney	agent	pay	Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ? 
Frederick Tilney	agent	has	He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	cared	“ Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? 
Frederick Tilney	agent	did	“ I am persuaded that he never did . ” “ And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ” Henry bowed his assent . 
Frederick Tilney	agent	made	But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? ” 
Frederick Tilney	agent	acted	She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe ; and indeed , as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted 
Frederick Tilney	agent	had	I do not know when poor Richard ’s cravats would be done , if he had no friend but you . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	perceived	Catherine , looking up , perceived Captain Tilney ; and Isabella , earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke , soon caught his notice . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	invited	He approached immediately , and took the seat to which her movements invited him . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	encouraging	It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella , and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him ; unconsciously it must be , for Isabella ’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	wore	Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! 
Frederick Tilney	patient	give	When I think of his past declarations , I give him up . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	mean	You will know , from this description , I must mean Captain Tilney , who , as you may remember , was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me , before you went away .

Frederick Tilney	patient	gone	they teased me into it ; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	injured	He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	justify	If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ” 
Frederick Tilney	patient	like	“ Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	like	Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all . 
Frederick Tilney	patient	see	In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	declared	Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand , her clothes put on with care , and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	made	With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protégée , Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door , as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow ; Catherine , however , kept close at her side , and linked her arm too firmly within her friend ’s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	did	Mrs. Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly , every now and then , “ I wish you could dance , my dear — I wish you could get a partner . ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	congratulated	Mrs. Allen congratulated herself , as soon as they were seated , on having preserved her gown from injury . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	replied	“ Yes , my dear , ” replied Mrs. Allen , with perfect serenity , “ it is very uncomfortable indeed . ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	wish	I wish we had a large acquaintance here . ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	wish	The Skinners were here last year — I wish they were here now . ” “ Had not we better go away as it is ? Here are no tea - things for us , you see . ” “ No more there are , indeed . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	think	but I think we had better sit still , for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd !

Mrs. Allen	agent	told	“ I am quite of your opinion , sir , ” replied Mrs. Allen ; “ and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	said	“ What a delightful place Bath is , ” said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock , after parading the room till they were tired ; “ and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here . ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	had	This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now ; but we are told to “ despair of nothing we would attain , ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	recognized	This question answered , as it readily was , the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe ; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate , whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages , and that many years ago . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	had	Mrs. Thorpe , however , had one great advantage as a talker , over Mrs. Allen , in a family of children ; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons , and the beauty of her daughters , when she related their different situations and views — that John was at Oxford , Edward at Merchant Taylors ’ , and William at sea — and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were , Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give , no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend , and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions , consoling herself , however , with the discovery , which her keen eyes soon made , that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe ’s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own . “ Here come my dear girls , ” cried Mrs. Thorpe , pointing at three smart - looking females who , arm in arm , were then moving towards her .

Mrs. Allen	agent	welcomed	James accepted this tribute of gratitude , and qualified his conscience for accepting it too , by saying with perfect sincerity , “ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James ’s part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	say	“ Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people — and indeed for everybody else too . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	tell	I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	tell	I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	have	I have no doubt that he will . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	said	“ Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? ” said Mrs. Allen . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	wish	he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , ” said Mrs. Allen ; 
Mrs. Allen	agent	said	he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , ” said Mrs. Allen ; 
Mrs. Allen	agent	made	and what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	replied	“ Do just as you please , my dear , ” replied Mrs. Allen , with the most placid indifference . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	returned	Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , “ Well , my dear , here you are , ” a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; “ and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	greeted	Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning , and was immediately greeted with , “ Well , my dear , here you are , ” a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute ; “ and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	had	Catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give , and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	thought	At about eleven o’clock , however , a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine ’s watchful eye , and “ Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , ” broke from her in a most desponding tone . “ I thought how it would be , ” said Mrs. Allen . “ No walk for me to - day , ” sighed Catherine ; “ but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . ”

Mrs. Allen	agent	know	“ No , ” replied her friend very placidly , “ I know you never mind dirt . ” After a short pause , “ It comes on faster and faster ! ” said Catherine , as she stood watching at a window . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	accompany	It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the pump - room ; he accordingly set off by himself , and Catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages , containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	declare	“ Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare ! 
Mrs. Allen	agent	go	they are coming for me perhaps — but I shall not go — I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . ”

Mrs. Allen	agent	agreed	Mrs. Allen agreed to it . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	persuade	“ Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , ” was the general cry . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	had	But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you ; now had not I , Mrs. Allen ? ” 
Mrs. Allen	agent	coming	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	used	Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ” “ But now you love a hyacinth . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	saw	Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ” “ But now you love a hyacinth . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	had	“ Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	given	James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford ; and Mrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to Fullerton . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	thought	I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . 
Mrs. Allen	agent	thought	and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself .

Mrs. Allen	agent	returned	Catherine could not answer ; and , after a short trial of other subjects , Mrs. Allen again returned to—“I really have not patience with the General !

Mrs. Allen	patient	congratulated	Mrs. Allen congratulated herself , as soon as they were seated , on having preserved her gown from injury . 
Mrs. Allen	patient	struck	Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius . 
Mrs. Allen	patient	consoling	Mrs. Thorpe , however , had one great advantage as a talker , over Mrs. Allen , in a family of children ; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons , and the beauty of her daughters , when she related their different situations and views — that John was at Oxford , Edward at Merchant Taylors ’ , and William at sea — and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were , Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give , no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend , and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions , consoling herself , however , with the discovery , which her keen eyes soon made , that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe ’s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own . “ Here come my dear girls , ” cried Mrs. Thorpe , pointing at three smart - looking females who , arm in arm , were then moving towards her . 
Mrs. Allen	patient	see	“ I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . ” 
Mrs. Allen	patient	puzzle	after a short silence , she added , “ he is a very agreeable young man . ” “ Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; “ I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . ” This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment ’s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , “ I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . ” Catherine was disappointed and vexed . 
Mrs. Allen	patient	expect	“ Something was said about it , I remember , ” said Catherine , looking at Mrs. Allen for her opinion ; “ but really I did not expect you . 
Mrs. Allen	patient	called	This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all ; Mrs. Allen was called on to second him , and the two others walked in , to give their assistance . 
Mrs. Allen	patient	join	Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking . 
Mrs. Allen	patient	amazed	How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	accomplished	She learnt a year , and could not bear it ; and Mrs. Morland , who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste , allowed her to leave off . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	knew	But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets , that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness , and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	entertained	But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets , that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness , and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations .

Mrs. Morland	agent	wish	“ I beg , Catherine , you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat , when you come from the Rooms at night ; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend ; I will give you this little book on purpose . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	insisted	It is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on Catherine ’s writing by every post , nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance , nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	exacted	It is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on Catherine ’s writing by every post , nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance , nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	wanted	Her father , instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker , or even putting an hundred pounds bank - bill into her hands , gave her only ten guineas , and promised her more when she wanted it . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	felt	She was come to be happy , and she felt happy already . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	had	She had neither beauty , genius , accomplishment , nor manner . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	had	She had a most harmless delight in being fine ; and our heroine ’s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn , and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	take	She had a most harmless delight in being fine ; and our heroine ’s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn , and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	do	Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand , her clothes put on with care , and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	depend	As for admiration , it was always very welcome when it came , but she did not depend on it . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	found	But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd ; it seemed rather to increase as they went on , whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door , they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	does	“ No , she does not . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	reads	She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . ” 
Mrs. Morland	agent	fall	She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . ” 
Mrs. Morland	agent	hurried	in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued , and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity , they were all seated round the tea - table , which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller , whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice , before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	observed	“ This has been a strange acquaintance , ” observed Mrs. Morland , as the letter was finished ; “ soon made and soon ended . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	hope	well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ” 
Mrs. Morland	agent	say	“ If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	dispatched	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed ; and her mother , perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect , proposed , as another expedient for restoring her spirits , that they should call on Mrs. Allen . The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James ’s disappointment .

Mrs. Morland	agent	is	We are sorry for him , ” said she ; “ but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; 
Mrs. Morland	agent	dare	Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	trodden	” This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could listen to ; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance , and made her reply less rational ; for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well - known road . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	had	It was not three months ago since , wild with joyful expectation , she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day , with an heart light , gay , and independent ; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed , and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	return	Three months ago had seen her all this ; and now , how altered a being did she return ! 
Mrs. Morland	agent	said	“ Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ” said she . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	travelled	“ She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house .

Mrs. Morland	agent	grew	“ She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	endeavoured	As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	confirming	It was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended ; and while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations , Catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ Henry must have arrived at Northanger ; _ now _ he must have heard of her departure ; and _ now _ , perhaps , they were all setting off for Hereford . CHAPTER 30 Catherine ’s disposition was not naturally sedentary , nor had her habits been ever very industrious ; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort , her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	allowed	For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint ; but when a third night ’s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness , improved her in useful activity , nor given her a greater inclination for needlework , she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of , “ My dear Catherine , I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	watched	Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse ; and seeing , in her daughter ’s absent and dissatisfied look , the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness , hastily left the room to fetch the book in question , anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady . 
Mrs. Morland	agent	pitied	Desirous of Mr. Morland ’s assistance , as well in giving encouragement , as in finding conversation for her guest , whose embarrassment on his father ’s account she earnestly pitied , Mrs. Morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him ; but Mr. Morland was from home — and being thus without any support , at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say .

Mrs. Morland	agent	did	Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did — they had been too kind to exact any promise ; and whenever Catherine received a letter , as , at that time , happened pretty often , they always looked another way . 
Mrs. Morland	patient	drown	A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness , and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together ; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet . 
Mrs. Morland	patient	come	She was come to be happy , and she felt happy already . 
Mrs. Morland	patient	turning	It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen , that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work , and how she will , probably , contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable — whether by her imprudence , vulgarity , or jealousy — whether by intercepting her letters , ruining her character , or turning her out of doors . 
Mrs. Morland	patient	fitted	In one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public , being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be . 
Mrs. Morland	patient	usher	Catherine too made some purchases herself , and when all these matters were arranged , the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms . 
Mrs. Morland	patient	told	“ And so I should , my dear , you may depend on it ; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting , I would always do the best for you in my power . 
Mrs. Morland	patient	received	She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked - for appearance , acting on a steady affection , would naturally call forth ; and great was their surprise , and warm their displeasure , on hearing how she had been treated — though Mrs. Morland ’s account of it was no inflated representation , no studied appeal to their passions .

Mrs. Morland	patient	impress	As they walked home again , Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter ’s mind the happiness of having such steady well - wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen , and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her , while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends .

Mr. Allen	agent	joined	look at the back . ” After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours ; it was thankfully accepted , and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it , which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening , till they were discovered and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over . 
Mr. Allen	agent	said	“ Well , Miss Morland , ” said he , directly , “ I hope you have had an agreeable ball . ” 
Mr. Allen	agent	hope	“ Well , Miss Morland , ” said he , directly , “ I hope you have had an agreeable ball . ” 
Mr. Allen	agent	hope	“ We shall do better another evening I hope , ” was Mr. Allen ’s consolation . 
Mr. Allen	agent	know	“ Men commonly take so little notice of those things , ” said she ; “ I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another . 
Mr. Allen	agent	thinks	“ Yes , very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . ” 
Mr. Allen	agent	does	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . 
Mr. Allen	agent	talks	I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . 
Mr. Allen	agent	joined	Mr. Allen , after drinking his glass of water , joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers ; and the ladies walked about together , noticing every new face , and almost every new bonnet in the room .

Mr. Allen	agent	declined	She applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of her hopes , but Mr. Allen , not having his own skies and barometer about him , declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine . 
Mr. Allen	agent	put	I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable .

Mr. Allen	agent	met	At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . 
Mr. Allen	agent	called	Here Catherine , who was much less gratified by his admiration than by General Tilney ’s , was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen . 
Mr. Allen	agent	caught	Mr. Allen caught at it directly . 
Mr. Allen	agent	said	“ Well , ” said he , “ and do you think of going too ? ” 
Mr. Allen	agent	wonder	it is not right ; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it . 
Mr. Allen	agent	know	“ I know you do ; but that is not the question .

Mr. Allen	agent	discouraged	Mr. Allen , however , discouraged her from doing any such thing . 
Mr. Allen	agent	support	With Mr. Allen to support her , she felt no dread of the event : but she would gladly be spared a contest , where victory itself was painful , and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them . 
Mr. Allen	agent	attended	Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion , 
Mr. Allen	agent	did	Neither her father nor Mr. Allen did so .

Mr. Allen	patient	ordered	Mr. Allen , who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton , the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived , was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution — and his lady , a good - humoured woman , fond of Miss Morland , and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village , she must seek them abroad , invited her to go with them .
